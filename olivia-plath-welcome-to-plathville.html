If you enjoyed <a href=#>Counting On</a>, but wanted more conflict, then this show gave you some of that in its early seasons.</p><p>Welcome to Plathville follows the Plaths, a conservative, <a href=#>strictly-religious family</a> that owns a farm in Georgia. The family is made of up parents Kim and Barry, and their nine children — Hosanna, Ethan, Micah, Moriah, Lydia, Isaac, Amber, Cassia, and Mercy.</p><p>However, things changed considerably in the family following the first couple of seasons and now, not only are Barry and Kim divorced, but the family has adopted more "worldy" views and Ethan and his wife, <a href=#>Olivia Plath</a>, are on the outs. Which has many wondering about Olivia and her future on the show.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span><p>Olivia & Ethan</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Welcome to Plathville exposes some tension between Olivia Plath and the rest of the family.</h2><p>While Counting On followed the faithful dedication the Duggar family members had to their religious values, this show isn't shy about revealing family troubles, specifically with Kim and Olivia.</p><p>Kim once accused Olivia of withholding money she and Ethan made together in a business and in turn, Olivia accused Kim of stealing from her son. And from there, things snowballed.</p><p>Although Olivia was once close to both Micah and Moriah Plath, two of Ethan's younger siblings, viewers see tension rise between the three of them when Olivia's issues with Kim interfere with Kim's relationship with her adult children. And by Season 5 of Welcome to Plathville, Olivia isn't on speaking terms with anyone in the family.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Facebook</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Olivia and Ethan announced their separation in 2023.</h2><p>The two met in 2014 on a "family camping trip," according to their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wedding website</a>. They didn't spend much time together, as there were over 2,000 other people on this camping trip, but they made a point to dance with each other a few times on the trip.</p><p>After the two departed, Ethan decided he was "smitten" with Olivia, while she was determined not to like him at first. Their relationship grew over the two and a half years they were long distance. They didn't go on their first official date until 2016, when Olivia came to visit the Plath family to spend time with Ethan. In 2017, he proposed to Olivia, and they were wed a year later.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Olivia Marie Plath (@oliviamarieplath)</a></p></figure><p>However, amid lots of struggles on and off the show and continued family drama, Ethan and Olivia decided to separate in 2023. In October 2023, Olivia released a statement on Instagram where she explained that she and Ethan made the decision to split up.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Olivia disagrees with the Plath lifestyle.</h2><p>While Olivia may have been raised in a similarly conservative family, she has opened up about the tensions between her and her Kim over the way the Plath children are raised.</p><p>“I have felt very negative about Kim,” Olivia admitted, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>. “Because even when Ethan and I were dating, I was criticized for what kind of toothpaste I used, or what I ate, or what I wore, or what I did."</p><p>She added, "I feel like I was constantly critiqued. Literally every time I get in my car to go over there, my stomach is in knots.”</p><p>Now that Olivia and Ethan have separated, it;s unclear what Olivia's future is on the show. But regardless, she seems to have no regrets about the live they shared.</p><p>Watch Welcome to Plathville on Tuesdays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpLmqwsiaZKmkkam1bsPEpZqopZViwbB5z6WYraCmnrmtsQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
