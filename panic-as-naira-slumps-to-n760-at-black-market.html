Sources linked the surge to next week’s inaugurations of new governors across the country.</p><p>The Guardian, however, could not independently confirm that the large volume of transactions is coming from the political circle. Previously, past governors and lawmakers had allegedly fled the country with ill-gotten wealth immediately after the end of their tenures for fear of being arrested by anti-corruption agencies.</p><p>This is not the first time naira would lose its hold ahead of the inauguration.
