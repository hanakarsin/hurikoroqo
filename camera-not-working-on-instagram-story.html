In fact, we can confirm that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Distractify's Instagram</a> is working perfectly and the Stories are pretty lit — if we do say so ourselves.

To do this, go to your profile on your app and tap on the three horizontal lines in the upper right-hand corner. Then look for "Recent Searches" and tap on that. You should now see an option that says "Clear Data." Tap on that and if it asks you to confirm, say yes.
