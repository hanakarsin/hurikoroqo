She's also a recent viral TikTok star. In one video that went insanely viral, Katherine shares the things she does every single time she checks into a hotel to make sure her stay is safe and happy.&nbsp;</p><p>The video has nearly six million views, 1.2 million likes, and more than 3,300 comments. Some of these tips and tricks are more obvious than others, but they are all a good idea to keep in mind when you are traveling and staying in hotels.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@katkamalani href=#>@katkamalani</a><p>HOTEL HACKS from a flight attendant! <a title=hotelhack href=#>##hotelhack</a> <a title=flightattendantlife href=#>##flightattendantlife</a> <a title=hoteltips href=#>##hoteltips</a> <a title=travelhack href=#>##travelhack</a> <a title=fyp href=#>##fyp</a> <a title=traveltips href=#>##traveltips</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - katkamalani" href=#>♬ original sound - katkamalani</a></figure><p>She says them pretttty fast, so let's go through these tips one by one. The first one might be something you've never even thought about before.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Never say your room number out loud.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok</a></figure><p>This is a big one! You don't want to advertise where you're staying to a bunch of strangers. I hate to say it, but this is especially true if you are a female-presenting person who is traveling alone. Tip number two is similar...</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Make sure there's no one behind you in the hallway when you're entering your room.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok</a></figure><p>Just make sure you're aware of your surroundings at all times, and make sure there's no one sneaking up behind you when you enter your room. This makes me think that something has happened to Katherine before, or that maybe she's heard some horror stories...</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Check behind the curtains and in all closets to make sure you're truly alone.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok</a></figure><p>I suppose it's a thing that sometimes people hide in hotel rooms that aren't theirs. When you get into your room, do a thorough sweep to make sure you are really alone. You don't want any middle-of-the-night visitors.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Always lock the top lock.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok</a></figure><p>Don't rely on the key lock when you're in your hotel room, especially at night. Always make sure to lock the top lock, which is usually a deadbolt of some kind, for that extra layer of security.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Check the mattress for bed bugs.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok</a></figure><p>I know it's gross, but it's a good idea to check the mattress for bed bugs before you set anything down in the room. You have to lift up the sheets and get under the folds on the corners to see what's going on, but believe me, it's worth it. You do not want to bring bed bugs with you back home.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Take any decorative pillows or blankets off of the bed.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok</a></figure><p>"They never wash those," Katherine says, matter-of-factly. Ew. Stick to the regular sheets, pillowcases, and blankets.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Never put your bag on the bed.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok</a></figure><p>Katherine makes a good point here. That thing has been rolling through an airport, lifted onto an airplane, maybe even manhandled by several people in the cargo section of the plane. Your bag is disgusting. Don't put it on the hotel bed.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Use the ice bucket to chill food if there's no refrigerator.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok</a></figure><p>Last but not least, Katherine says that if you don't have a refrigerator in your room, you can always fill up the ice bucket and chill your food that way. She's been in the business for a long time so she knows exactly how to optimize hotel travel. If I were you, I'd heed her advice.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfm7mqs8etZJqspJq7pa3NrWShp6SauW7A0ZqtnqRdna6kt9Jmq6KjpKS4</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
