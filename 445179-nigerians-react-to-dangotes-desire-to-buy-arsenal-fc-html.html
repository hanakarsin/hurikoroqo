In fact going by FIFA regulations, none of our clubs has met the required standards of a club that a person like Dangote could have owned."</i></p><p>Still,&nbsp;Onigbinde realizes that Dangote's decision has to do with business, not emotions.</p><p><i>"We should not be emotional on that ground.&nbsp;It is only when you bring in patriotism that it looks morally wrong, but first and foremost, he is a businessman. And so is only normal for him to spread his tentacles wisely.</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=#>What Aliko Dangote Looked Like Before He Made All The Billions (Photos)</a></p><p><i>"Business and sentiments do not mix. If I may advise, I think what we need more in this country is someone to back the overhauling of our grassroots programmes. If Dangote decides to focus on sports development, the youth of this country will not forget him because sports in general are what has brought fame to some ghetto children."</i></p><p>Amos Adamu, a former Director-General, National Sports Commission, expressed a similar point of view:</p><p><i>"It is practical, there are people in Nigeria that have never been to the stadium to watch the Nigerian league matches but as businessmen will naturally align with success.</i></p><p><i>"These same people will do anything within their means to ensure that they watch international leagues like the Barclays Premier League and co; they are die-hard supporters of teams like Arsenal. We are looking at it as football, but it is business for him, but people investing in football are doing it to make more money.</i></p><p><i>"He has interest and he can make more money from it so why not, it is purely business no strings attached. There are certain things you like in life that makes you happy."</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> <a href=#>Photos: Aliko Dangoteâ€™s Daughter Graduates</a></p><p>Felix Owolabi, former Super Eagles player, feels fine about Dangote's decision:</p><p><i>"To start with he is a business tycoon that wants to expand his frontiers. So, I personally have no problems with that, there is no point bringing elements of morality into this."</i></p><p>What do you think about Dangote's aspiration?</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgXWBkHBwZqaZnLKztcCnqmaqlZawtXnTqGSdmZ6cvLWx0mabnquZp7JuwM5mma6xXZa%2FtLHNmqNmnpNjtbW5yw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
