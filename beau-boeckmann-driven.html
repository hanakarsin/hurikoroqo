Before we get started, though, watch the trailer for the new series, below.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTu</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Beau Boeckmann has been part of the car business his entire life, long before 'Driven'.</h2><p>Beau was born into a family full of diehard car enthusiasts in Glendale, Calif. His father, Bert Boeckmann, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bought Galpin Ford, the largest Ford dealership in America, in 1968</a>, according to Galpin Ford, and he fell in love with his first car, a 1957 Thunderbird, at the age of 15, according to Galpin Ford's official website. After graduating Hoover High School, he went on to study business at University of Southern California.&nbsp;</p><p>After he graduated from USC with a Bachelor's in business, Beau went on to work for his car-lovin' father at the family business. He eventually worked his way up to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CEO of customizing shop Galpin Auto Sports</a>, and then, proceeded to take over as Chief Operating Officer of the entire company, according to Auto News. His father, now 83 years old, is still working for the company, serving as chairman and the CEO, with Beau basically leading the way.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>It’s official!

He was in a wide variety of episodes, so at this point, he's most likely pretty tight with the former Late Night talk show host. Needless to say, he's definitely a solid friend to have, if automotives are up your alley. And now that he's starring on Driven, reviving countless famous cars, it's safe to say he's going to have even more interesting experiences under his belt.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><p>Loving and knowing everything there is to know about cars is basically ingrained into Beau Boeckmann's DNA. Driven certainly snagged some seriously credible names for the show —&nbsp;buckle up, and get ready for a fast-paced docu-series filled with car glow-ups, historical tidbits, and magical automotive moments. It's definitely something to look forward to while you're cooped up in your house and —&nbsp;well —&nbsp;definitely not driving around.</p><p>Catch the premiere of Driven on Discovery at Monday, March 30 at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7KiwYybpp6bm6Kur7qMnamirpWj</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
