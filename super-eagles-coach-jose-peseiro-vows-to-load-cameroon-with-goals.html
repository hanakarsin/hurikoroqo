This is because of how they have been struggling to score goals.</p><p>Recall that they drew 1-1 with Equatorial Guinea courtesy of a header from Victor Osimhen after a series of missed goalscoring opportunities.</p><p>In their second group stage game, Jose Peseiro and his boys managed to beat 2023 AFCON hosts, Ivory Coast 1-0 courtesy of a penalty kick from the team’s vice-captain William Troost-Ekong.</p><p>While in their last group stage game, which was against the struggling Guinea-Bissau, the Super Eagles still failed to convert their chances. They managed to score just a goal courtesy of an own goal.</p><p>This means that in three games, the Nigerian team has managed to score just a goal from an open play which is disappointing based on the caliber of players in the team.</p><p>Interestingly, at 9 p.m. on Saturday, January 27, <a href=# rel=noopener>the Nigerian team will face Cameroon who scored five goals and conceded 6 goals in the group stage.</a></p><p>Ahead of the meeting between the two African heavyweights, coach Jose Peseiro said: “For the next match, we’re going to score.</p><p>“We need to score goals, but it’s a difficult tournament. We deserve to reach the first position because, against Equatorial Guinea, we created many chances, but we didn’t score. Equatorial Guinea did not beat us, they drew us.</p><p>“I’m happy about that, and I’ll wait for the next match. It’s not easy to win one match in this competition. It’s not easy.”</p><p>He added: “First objective attained! With two wins and one draw and with no goals conceded in the last two matches, we are in the last 16 of the AFCON.</p><p>“Next Saturday, we will be there with the same focus, determination, and commitment so that we can move to the quarter-finals.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5FtZqytoJq%2FbrHAoKOeq12YvKKvx2ahqKuVYr2mv8SiqahlpqTEtHnTqGSlp5GZeqStzJ6pqKeeYsSqwMdmnqiZnKh8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
