See the video and learn more here.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Waking up in our carefully constructed domiciles, filled with soft linens and mattresses, putting on clothes with specific names developed by large conglomerations and pressing a series of buttons to imbibe water and heated brown bean juice, and eating food that comes pre-packed from another structure or is delivered directly to our home — it's easy to forget that we're basically renting the wilderness from Mother Nature. And this <a href=#>bobcat attack</a> that's trending on <a href=#>TikTok</a> now is a reminder of that.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">This TikTok video shows a bobcat attacking a woman — until her husband intervened.</h2><p>The beginning of the clip starts off innocuously enough. We see a man walking to his car and he sets a drink on the hood of his vehicle. As he goes to the back of the vehicle to load it up with something, we see his wife walk into frame and she starts freaking out. Then we hear a growl; a Bobcat for some reason decided to attack the woman and then we hear a bit of a scuffle and we see the dude holding the cat up in the air and he tosses it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>What has people cracking up is how the dude in the video clip goes from "I need to wash my car" to "I'm gonna shoot that f******" in a span of seconds, and the subsequent freakout after the Bobcat appears.</p><p>Watch it for yourself to see what all of the fuss is about.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>“A BOBCAT ATTACK MY WIFE! A BOBCAT!” I’m dying 😭😭😭 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/6GkyhUGfKv</a></p>— Rich O'Toole (@RichOToole) <a href=#>April 15, 2021</a> <span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">I have a theory why so many people are enamored with this bobcat attack video on TikTok.</h2><p>And that's because it hits a lot of "viral" internet moments. One: There's no way that this could ever be staged. You can tell from the entire clip and everyone's reactions that this is entirely real and they locked into beast mode to get rid of the bobcat.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Pretty small bobcat</p>— Marshall (@Piker73) <a href=#>April 15, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>JESUS CHRIST IT WAS A WILD ANIMAL and bobcats in Colorado are about thag big if not even a little bit taller so SHUT UP I would like to size up any man next to this guy. WOW.</p>— g&t kisses⚡️ (@saritarain) <a href=#>April 16, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Two: It's kind of hilarious to see everyone flip their s--t once the bobcat starts attacking his wife. Plus there's the added bit of seeing someone manhandle a wild animal without actually harming it. It's not like the guy was abusive; he was just throwing the bobcat away and scaring it. Sure, he threatens to shoot the thing. But it's not like he tried harming it further.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>He said <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/m67x5j7NON</a></p>— Wes on the set, Carl on the check.

Human beings are silly creatures. I'm pretty sure that guy wasn't thinking about how clean his car was when he was wrestling a wild bobcat away from his wife and tossing it across the yard like he was at shot put practice.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7yjr8CtZJqspJawrHnToqKtp5s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
