Tabloids immediately rushed to assume she was cheating on João, though Magui denied having such an affair with Pedro.</p><p>“If I wanted to be kissing someone in an intimate moment, it would not be in Lust. Much less in the VIP section with that small balcony and in view of the entire nightclub,” she said at the time, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sports Grail.</a> "I met [Pedro] unexpectedly at a group meal a few months ago. And we have had a terrific time since then, we are really close friends, I adore him, he is incredible.”</p><p>"I have a special relationship with her, no one is being unfaithful to anyone," Pedro said of the rumors.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>In June 2023, the pair confirmed they had split, though offered no clear timeline as to when their relationship ended. Around the same time, Magui was spotted with F1 driver Lando Norris.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"João and I achieved goals together for a few years, in a phase of change, growth and learning," Magui wrote on social media, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Goal</a>. "Not having been together as a couple for some time, I am lucky enough to be a part of his life. We appreciate all the messages from those who really care about us. We are fine, happy and friends as we always were. He will return here and then we'll see what happens. We have got nothing planned."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does João Félix have a girlfriend?</h2><p>Though much of João's recent career has seen him publicly tied to the Portuguese actress and model, it seems that he's flying solo for the moment. The pair announced their split officially earlier in the year, but that hasn't stopped fans from speculating online that they may be back together.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>The back and forth about his relationship status has clearly bothered João, who made the decision to address it directly online. In response to the rumors that he was back with Magui, he made a simple post setting the record straight.</p><p>"That's not true, I'm single," he wrote, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marca</a>.</p><p>It seems for the moment the athlete is choosing to take some time away from the dating field, though he's made it clear he still holds great respect for his ex. Whether or not they ever reconcile remains to be seen, but it's clear from both of their social media accounts that they have no issue confirming or denying the various rumors.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7yiu4yfnKWhqGKxosDIp54%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
