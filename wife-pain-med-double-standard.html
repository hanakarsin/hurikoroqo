While many doctors say that it generally takes 6-8 weeks to fully recover physically for both delivery methods, every person's labor is different, and each person experiences varying levels of pain.</p><p>However, one mom thought there was a clear double standard when she compared the levels of pain she received as a mother who just delivered a baby via c-section, versus the tummy ache her husband experienced as a result of him possibly having appendicitis.</p><p>A TikToker named Griselda (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@gvillegas01</a>) uploaded a now-viral video to the app that's received over 717,000 likes. In the clip, her husband can be seen hooked up to an IV drip of sorts on a medical table, his body propped up at a slight angle.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@gvillegas01 href=#>@gvillegas01</a><p>Women are superior and the U.S health system sucks ass!l <a title=womenshistorymonth href=#>#womenshistorymonth</a> <a title=toomuchlabor href=#>#toomuchlabor</a></p><a title="♬ labour - Paris Paloma" href=#>♬ labour - Paris Paloma</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @gvillegas01</span></figure><p>Griselda writes in a text overlay in the clip, "Being by my husband's side while he has a stomach ache caused by 'possible appendicitis' and seeing the nurse give him morphine for the pain, but thinking about how after my c-section and my colposcopy I was only given Tylenol and ibuprofen."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @gvillegas01</span></figure><p>She adds in a caption for the post, "Women are superior and the U.S. health system sucks a**!"</p><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">American Society of Anesthesiologists</a>, post-partum c-section patients can be medically cleared to have morphine administered to them.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @gvillegas01</span></figure><p>The center goes on to state that in "most cases" after the 18-hour or so period of morphine pain management wears off, doctors can prescribe "oral opioids" in order to help women manage their pain. And while the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cleveland Clinic</a> states that a colposcopy should be "relatively painless" there were several women in the comments section of Griselda's video who claimed otherwise.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @gvillegas01</span></figure><p>In fact, even though there are a number of medical outlets that it's entirely safe for women to use <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">morphine after giving birth</a>, and even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">breastfeed their child while taking the drug</a>, a number of TikTokers said that they've seen women deprived of the effective pain relief agent time and time again.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @gvillegas01</span></figure><p>One commenter wrote in response to her clip, "YUP. I'm a medical assistant and I literally see this every. single. day"</p><p>Another woman said, "I screamed during my colposcopy and passed out from the cramps after. Worst pain ever. When I broke my foot I kept running on it"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @gvillegas01</span></figure><p>One user suggested that there's an attitude from medical staff that assumes women are simply being dramatic or are lying about the amount of pain that they're in: "I went in for unbearable leg pain and got given the 'have you considered you're just making it up' attitude. It was blood clots from birth control."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @gvillegas01</span></figure><p>Apparently, this same phenomenon is witnessed from multiple vocations in the medical field: "I'm a pharmacy tech and see this alllll the time. Man & woman can have the same procedure—they'll send her an RX for ibuprofen and the man a c2"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @gvillegas01</span></figure><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">National Institutes of Health</a>, there does seem to be a level of gender bias when it comes to administering pain medication to patients: women and minorities "receive less analgesic than men and nonminority patients."</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harvard University</a> also said that women are more likely to be prescribed sedatives rather than painkillers, when compared to men.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLansYypmKKmXaKypXnDqKybpJViwLWtzZ2Yq5w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
