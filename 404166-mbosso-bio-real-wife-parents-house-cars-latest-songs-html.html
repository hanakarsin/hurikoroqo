His birth name is Joseph Kulungi. He <a id=https://www.famousbirthdays.com/people/mbosso.html href=# rel="nofollow noopener">was born on</a> 3rd October 1991, meaning he is 29 years old as of 2021. Mbosso was brought up by humble parents – his father was a conductor, while his mother was a small scale farmer.</p><p class=align-left>Where is Mbosso from? The Bongo Flava star was born in Tanzania. He particularly spent most of his childhood in a place known as Kibiti, Rufiji in TZ. Growing in a humble background was an unpleasant experience for him. He was forced to work at a <a href=#>fast-food restaurant</a> to help his <a href=#>family</a> put food on the table.</p><p class=align-left>Mbosso studied until form four. Unfortunately, he had to end it there because of his family background. Instead, he requested his parents to allow him to pursue his passion – music. He eventually managed to persuade them to leave for Dare Salam.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/91b85ecd263a1701.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Mr Blue biography: family, net worth, songs, facts and latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>On arriving in Dare Salam, life was not easy. At some point, he contemplated going back to the village. After several days in the city, Mkubwa Fella bumped into him in the street while playing the guitar. He introduced him to his band, <i>Wakubwa na Wanawe</i>.</p><h3>Career</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/d4eccadf10d65cf6.jpeg><p class=align-left>He launched his music career with <i>Wakubwa na Wanawe</i>, which later became known as <i>Yamoto Band</i>. The band comprised three other equally gifted young singers, namely Enock Bella, Aslay, and Beka Flavour.</p><p class=align-left>The band released a few tracks that performed extremely well. Nevertheless, the group was <a id=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/entertainment/showbiz/2001247462/yamoto-band-splits-up-here-are-the-issues-behind-the-cold-break-up href=# rel="nofollow noopener">disbanded in 2018</a>. It later emerged that the boys had issues among themselves that forced them to part ways. Some of them believed that they could do better on their own.</p><p class=align-left>Mbosso left Dar es Salaam for Kibiti, his home, feeling disappointed. On arriving home, he went back to farming with his mother. Considering they had a small farm, it could not sustain all their needs. So, he started to engage in criminal activities.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0f3c4e2b7f347a1c.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Mesach Semakula biography: wife, house, cars, songs, life story</span></p></a><p class=align-left>One day, he received a surprise guest, <a href=#>Rayvanny</a>. He was able to convince him to go back to singing. Interestingly, <a href=#>Rayvanny</a> took him to <i>WCB Wasafi </i>record label, where he was signed as a new artist.</p><p class=align-left>The first six months were not the best for him while in WCB. The record label had instructed him to complete recording his album before introducing him to the audience. At some point, he contemplated going back to his old ways of stealing.</p><p class=align-left>His first song under WCB was <i>Watakubali</i>. <a id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvomUKKHHA" href=# rel="nofollow noopener">According to him</a>, the song was inspired by true events.
