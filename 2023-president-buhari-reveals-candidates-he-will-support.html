For the first time, a non-PDP government came to power with a huge majority after 16 years of the Fourth Republic. His constant refrain is: “I will not betray or undermine my party by supporting candidates other than those of the APC.”</p><h2>No Target Person In Mind</h2><p>The statement however clarified that the President’s statement and position is not against any particular person but other parties and candidates are welcome to support APC candidates.</p><p>He said:&nbsp;“This statement is not against any particular candidate. However, our stand is clear that only those candidates fielded by the All Progressives Candidates, APC will enjoy the support of the President and they are the ones he will campaign for. However, we welcome support for our candidates at all levels by other parties.”</p><p>Buhari also re-affirmed his commitment “to enforce discipline, synchronization and coordination” at all levels of the APC.</p><h2>Don’t Give Political Points To Our Opponents</h2><p>Continuing in the statement, President Buhari cautioned officials in his administration against making unguarded statements that can be used against them by the opposition.</p><p>The President warned presidential villa officials against “engaging in loose talk”, while urging them “to resist making controversial statements” that may hurt the party and the government.</p><p>According to him, loose talks can be “a weapon for the opposition to use against the administration, the party or its candidates” in the election.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e5FtZmtoYmh6sb7ErKCdnZ6peqPBx5qpomWimsOmrcusZJyZnpm2pa3TnqpmoJVixKq4y2aqrqigpL%2B1ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
