What happened?</h2><p>The first time around, when Morgan was dropped back in 2023, there were rumors that perhaps she'd gotten dropped because of her more realistic approach to documenting rush, rather than sugarcoating it. Folks thought that because she didn't have the typical OOTDs, or the typical type of videos, this may have worked against her, especially in the wake of the <a href=#>2023 HBO doc Bama Rush</a>, which shed a harsher light on the program. It also apparently didn't help that Morgan had complained about the cost of the process.</p><p>As for this year, why was Morgan dropped again? Obviously we can't say for sure. But if you ask some of the users on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GreekRant.com</a>, they might say it partially has to do with the fact that she's continued posting videos when apparently posting "can hurt your chances."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@on_thedaily_with_morgan href=#>@on_thedaily_with_morgan</a><p>Bama Rush Day 6 OOTD <a title=bamamorgan href=#>#bamamorgan</a> <a title=bamarushtok href=#>#bamarushtok</a> <a title=bamarush href=#>#bamarush</a> <a title=rushtok href=#>#rushtok</a> <a title=bama href=#>#bama</a> <a title=ootd href=#>#ootd</a> <a title=ootdinspo href=#>#ootdinspo</a> <a title=ootdinspo href=#>#ootdinspo</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Bama Morgan" href=#>♬ original sound - Bama Morgan</a></figure><p>"THEY TELL YOU NOT TO POST!" wrote one user on the GreekRant forum. "They tell you it can hurt your chances. If she really wanted a house she would have waited. I'm sorry for her. I am. And yes, some people still get in a sorority after posting OOTD's, but it is a massive liability to have someone who airs every piece of their life on social media. She posts about everything, not just a simple OOTD with her friends during rush week."</p><p>If you really want to get deep in the weeds, you can read the thread over there, because people have all kinds of speculations. One commenter guessed it might have to do with the fact that Morgan's a "sophomore with junior credits," which would mean she'd "be in the sorority for much less time as a member compared to freshman." The commenter added, "Which sorority wants that???"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@on_thedaily_with_morgan href=#>@on_thedaily_with_morgan</a><p>It’s been a wild ride, thank you to everyone for your support. <a title=bamamorgan href=#>#bamamorgan</a> <a title=rush href=#>#rush</a> <a title=rushhour3 href=#>#rushhour3</a> <a title=rushbagnecessities href=#>#rushbagnecessities</a> <a title=alabama href=#>#alabama</a> <a title=relatablerush href=#>#relatablerush</a> <a title=relatablerush href=#>#relatablerush</a> <a title=bamarush href=#>#bamarush</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Bama Morgan" href=#>♬ original sound - Bama Morgan</a></figure><p>There are also people on the forum who are rooting for Morgan and think she genuinely wants to be in a sorority and could benefit from it. "It's clear she wants to be in a sorority and experience it, make friends, and get involved," one person wrote. "Does she post about it on TikTok? Yes! But so do most other girls who rush. It's no different."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl66urYympqufkaN6pb7OqaeenF2WtKK1zQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
