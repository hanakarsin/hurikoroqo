But Patrick's little brother, <a href=#>Jackson Mahomes</a>, has made a name for himself off the field and on the apps. <a href=#>TikTok</a>, to be more specific.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jackson has a million followers</a> on the social media platform, but that doesn't mean everyone is a fan.

He often posts videos of himself dancing and hanging out on the sidelines at games. Recently, he posted a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">clip of himself</a> standing next to what seems to be a private jet with the caption, "Made it to Arizona" (where the Super Bowl was held).</p><p>This behavior has some dubbing him "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hateable</a>," and "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cringey</a>," a reputation that Jackson seems to be at least somewhat aware of. (His TikTok bio reads, "'Sup, I get bullied a lot but I’m still here.")</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@jacksonmahomes href=#>@jacksonmahomes</a><p>Made it to Arizona! <a title=superbowl href=#>#superbowl</a></p><a title="♬ Girls want Girls - Neon" href=#>♬ Girls want Girls - Neon</a></figure><p>Aside from not being everyone's cup of tea, Jackson has also been embroiled in his fair share of actual controversy. He's in a vague social media feud with Barstool Sports's Dave Portnoy (but like, <a href=#>who isn't</a>?). Jackson also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">poured water on Ravens fans</a> after a 2021 Chiefs loss.</p><p>In October of that same year, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jackson formally apologized</a> after filming a TikTok dance on top of former Washington Football Team defensive back Sean Taylor's number, which was painted on the sideline of the field. It was a tribute to Taylor, whose life was cut tragically short after he was shot during a break-in at his home near Miami. His number was being retired that day.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>For me to even acknowledge Jackson Mahomes he must've done something irredeemably stupid like dancing on the memorial of a beloved player who died prematurely while his family was in attendance on the day they retired his number.

Others pointed out that, while Jackson may have been told to stand on Sean's number, no one told him that he had to film a video dancing on it.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Many were not looking forward to Jackson's Super Bowl TikToks.</h2><p>It's safe to say at this point that Jackson Mahomes is a divisive figure, but that hasn't stopped him from being very active on TikTok. As soon as the Chiefs clinched the ALC championship on Jan. 29, 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jackson tweeted</a>, "SUPER BOWL LET'S F--KING GO," to the excitement of very few.</p><p>Folks on Twitter had a field day with the Jackson Mahomes jabs.

He's gained a following and doesn't shy away from the spotlight, and that has proven to be damaging, to an extent. From the content he continues to post, though, it doesn't seem like Jackson Mahomes is all that concerned with what others think of him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn66kt9KopWalkZ28rrHSZquio6SkuA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
