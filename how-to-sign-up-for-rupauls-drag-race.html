It's definitely a process, but it's well worth the trouble if you want to be part of it.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How do you sign up for 'RuPaul's Drag Race'?</h2><p>When any given season is airing new episodes, there is usually an online form available to sign up for the next season. When <a href=#>Season 14</a> premiered, casting was already underway for Season 15. And although the deadline was Jan. 7, 2022, you can still access the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">online application</a>. In order to apply for RuPaul's Drag Race, you have to fill out the application and agree to a background check.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Then, you make and upload a video introducing yourself to the show's producers. That may be the most time-consuming portion of the process, but it's all part of showing off who you are.
