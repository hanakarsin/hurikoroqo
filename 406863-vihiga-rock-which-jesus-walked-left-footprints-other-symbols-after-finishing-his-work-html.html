He failed to do it, neither has his successor Wilbur Ottichilo done so,” Angara said.<p class=align-left>Contrary to the locals’ claims, Ottichilo recently said his administration was focused on mapping and protecting tourist attraction sites.</p>“We have many historical and tourist attraction sites and as a government, we are working to secure and develop them,” he said.<p class=align-left>Despite Jesus’s footprints on the rock having a spectacular and rare feature, the area is not yet secured, human activities are now eroding many symbols.</p>“We don’t charge any fee to those visiting the rock. Worshippers come a long way to quench their desires on this rock. It’s a blessing indeed,” Angara said.<p class=align-left>She, however, said, if not protected, human activities would erode the amazing symbols and make the rock lose its aesthetic and religious value.</p><p class=align-left><strong><i>Story by Collins Mbullika, TUKO.co.ke - Vihiga county</i></strong></p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/441583d73f83253a.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Katerina singer on the spot for branding Rwandese singers Meddy, The Ben lazy</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong><i>Do you have a groundbreaking story you would like us to publish?
