Becca Haley and Austin Reed, Emily Balch and Brennan Shoykhet, and Clare Kerr and Cameron Frazer all meet with the experts to make their final decision about their relationships.</p><p>Meanwhile, we learn that Lauren Goodger and Orion Martzloff had already called it quits by that point. But there's one couple we don't get to hear from on the standard Decision Day date: <a href=#>Chloe Brown</a> and <a href=#>Michael Shiakallis</a>. However, later, they do get to have their own Decision Day, and we have all the info about that.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Lifetime</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What happens on Michael and Chloe's Decision Day on 'Married at First Sight'?</h2><p>Since MAFS gave Michael another shot at love after his initial match left him at the altar, he and Chloe aren't been together as long as the other couples this season. That said, they have more time to continue putting their relationship to the test after the initial Season 17 Decision Day for the other pairs.</p><p>Given their late start, it was important to Pastor Cal and the experts that they didn't rush Michael and Chloe. And toward the end of the season, we finally see Chloe and Michael's Decision Day.</p><p>Despite her concerns about their marriage, Chloe actually says yes to staying together. However, Michael says in the episode, he isn't as ready as he thought he was to be in a marriage. And since both parties have to agree to remain married, these two are among the other divorced couples of the season.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Lifetime</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Are Michael and Chloe still together?</h2><p>It's unclear if Michael and Chloe are still together on MAFS. They have very different styles, and Michael's is somewhat unconventional and not a turn on for her. "I'm not used to a man wearing my earrings," she admits in an episode after Michael says he wants to wear one of her earrings in his ear.</p><p>Chloe also tells her costars Lauren, Clare, and Emily that it‚Äôs ‚Äúfun to watch‚Äù his fashion choices. But, she adds, "when it comes to sexual attraction, having that flair and that really fashion-forward personality has been a challenge for me, which is hard."</p><p>When Michael says he doesn't want to stay married, he also mentions pursuing something with Chloe outside of the experiment. However, it's not clear if they went that route after filming ended.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Chloe if you already knew that Michael wasn‚Äôt ready, why did you say Yes, then? ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è <a href=#>#mafs</a> <a href=#>#MarriedAtFirstSight</a> <a href=#>#MAFSDenver</a> <a href=#>#MarriedAtFirstSightDenver</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/MFs0rYsgfZ</a></p>‚Äî HOT CHOCOLATE (@DAT_HENNY_CHICK) <a href=#>March 28, 2024</a></figure><p style=text-align:start>In the past, some Married at First Sight participants found more success in dating after the show filmed. And at the very least, Michael has proven to himself that he can commit to another partner, even if he chose not to stay married to Chloe. So it is entirely possible that they chose to see each other again IRL after they season finished filming.</p><p style=text-align:start>Watch Married at First Sight on Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EST on Lifetime.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforaktMCeo2aZnpl6pLTLqJxmnJWYtrS1zqdknZmpYrqivtGinJ1lkal6p7XRrKtmq5mctbU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
