But it looks like Hannah actually picked musician <a href=#>Jed Wyatt</a>.</p><p>"Hannah chose Jed at the end and they are engaged," RS wrote before revealing that fans are surprised by her decision. "Sorry the initial Tyler info was wrong. Just wasn’t as solid as I thought it was. But the info about Jed from 3 weeks ago is as solid as I can get and I just have to leave it at that."</p><p>He continued, "I’m well aware people will still hold out hope it’s Tyler and you have every right to. All I’m doing is telling you what I was told based on the people I’ve spoken with, the information I’ve seen, and frankly, one major piece of information that’s floating out there. I’m confident in this and I’ll leave it at that."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Following the news of Jed's girlfriend, Hannah B. called off her engagement.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Nashville singer Haley Stevens revealed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> magazine that she was in relationship with Jed right before filming of The Bachelorette began.&nbsp;</p><p>“He said, ‘It’s probably not going to happen, but it’s a huge opportunity. I’m only doing this for my music.’ He only did it for his career,” she told the outlet. “He told me, 'It’s not real. It’s acting.'”</p><p>Now, RS is revealing that Hannah B. is still with Jed, but decided to call off their engagement. "I can confirm that Hannah broke off her engagement to Jed earlier this week. &nbsp;They are still 'together,' but the engagement is off. This isn't a 'don't ever talk to me again' from what I'm being told, but it's also not all rainbows and daffodils either," he tweeted.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>Reality Steve added, "This is a logical thing for Hannah to do. She had to. Just to re-evaluate everything going on bc she was essentially lied to and is now finding out stuff about her fiancé I'm guessing she had no clue about. Will find out more and have it for you next week."&nbsp;</p><p>Watch new episodes of The Bachelorette every Monday at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZKGZnqOuqXnBq6awpl2au6itxp6bZqyf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
