I can tell you categorically that they are not doing enough.</p><p>“The president is the Chief Commander of the Armed Forces. Giving orders that the security agencies should provide a solution has lingered for seven years.</p><p>“The government can fish out anybody at any time they want to. I believe they are not doing anything to fish out these bandits.</p><p>“They are all Nigerians and they don’t live outside Nigeria. If the security forces can use intelligence reports and gatherings, I believe the problem will not last for six months.</p><p>“I believe that the president has not backed his words with action.”</p><p>The lawmaker’s statement comes days after Ansaru terrorists <a href=#>banned political activities</a> in Birnin-Gwari community and other communities in Kaduna.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH13e5FyZputmJa%2FqnnHmqpmnpGeuaawjK2mZquVmMKzsYytn55lk6TCr8DRsmSaqJNiuaLDzJqinqpf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
