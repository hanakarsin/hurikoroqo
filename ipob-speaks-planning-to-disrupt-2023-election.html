To this effect, IPOB is neither contemplating nor will it encourage or sponsor anyone or any group to disrupt the election, Nigeria’s shambolic selection process called an election.”</p><p>IPOB said it has constantly made it public that the group have no interest in and cannot legitimise the aberration they call an election in Nigeria, adding that “we are a focused, determined and disciplined freedom fighting movement, not political thugs and IPOB is devoted to the cause of liberating our people from subjugation and from modern-day slavery and Neo-colonialism and will not allow ourselves to be distracted from this very objective.”</p><p>The group continued that it is not interested and will never be involved in any Nigeria fraudulent pre-election or post-election issues and that its job is to open the eyes of the blinds by the gospel of truth which our leader has delivered already.</p><p>“Whoever that is sponsoring any group or gang tagging them IPOB is on his/her own. For those who are hard of hearing, IPOB is one indivisible family under one central command and leadership,” the statement read in part.</p><p>The group rather accused the federal government of masterminding insecurity in the South East, with the hope of causing fear and accusing IPOB of their deeds.</p><p>“If in the future IPOB leadership decides to make a further statement on the upcoming Nigeria selection process called an election, we shall make a statement through our official channels,” the group noted.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe49xZqKon5d6tLzEmqKsZaChrq%2B6yKeeZqyfYrGqv9Gup61lYmV%2FdHnEpZycrJmku3A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
