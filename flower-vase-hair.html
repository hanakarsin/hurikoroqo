This year, one trend that's on everybody's lips didn't start on the runway. Rather, it began (where else) on social media.</p><p>Earlier this month, fashion and lifestyle vlogger Taylor R (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@iamtay_tay</a>) shared a Beyonc√©-inspired floral hairstyle she's been rocking, which draws from the superstar's Tyler Mitchell-shot September Vogue cover. "We all can‚Äôt wear gardens on our head because we‚Äôre not Beyonc√© so wear the more practical version now... <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">#<strong>FlowerVaseHair</strong></a> is here, create yours," Taylor captioned a video she shared on Twitter.</p><p>If you're bored of your everyday ponytail, or want to add some glamorous touches to your usual updo, <strong>#FlowerVaseHair</strong> might be the trend your locks never knew they needed.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Beyonc√© (@beyonce)</a> on Aug 6, 2018 at 6:03am PDT</p></figure><p>Taylor's video tutorial begins with inspiration shots of Beyonc√© and Rihanna donning fabulous floral headpieces. Like, it seriously looks like they're rocking full botanical gardens on their heads.</p><p>Then, it shows Taylor thinking, "Hmmm... How can I make this a little smaller, sculpted & more practical?"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Enter <strong>#FlowerVaseHair</strong>, this fall's latest hair trend that's sweeping social media up by storm. Easily achievable in eight simple steps, girls around the world are living for this hair look and sharing their styles on Twitter and Instagram.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">So, how do you style #FlowerVaseHair?</h2><p>According to Taylor's tutorial, sporting #FlowerVaseHair isn't as difficult as it looks. All you need is long hair, a hairbrush, a water bottle, flowers, and three hair ties (two small ones and one large elastic).</p><p>First, you'll separate your hair into two halves and brush it out. Then, you place a water bottle on top of your head and camouflage it with your hair to cover the plastic base. Tie a small elastic at the top of the bottle, a big elastic at the bottom (where the bottle meets the crown of your head), and tie your last one in the middle.</p><p>The last three steps are where you'll want to get more gingerly, as these will affect the overall neatness and presentation of your floral hair look.&nbsp;</p><p>Smooth your bottle-hiding updo with a brush or thin comb, then place the ends of your hair inside the hole at the top of the bottle. Next, add whatever plants of flowers you'd like, and tada: <strong>#FlowerVaseHair</strong>!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>After Taylor's floral hair inspiration went viral, women and girls all around the world chimed in to share their creations.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>"Decided to finally embrace myself and put my hair like fashion icon @iamtay_tay.<strong> </strong>Truly an excellent hairstyle for September. And spring too, I guess," Eri Shark captioned the photo above before adding, "Learning from the best!!! Asdf I wish I had a smaller bottle so I could have shaped my hair in a decent way but oh well."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: instagram</a></figure><p>"This look was inspired by @taytay_xx üíê‚ù§üåπ #flowervasehair #septemberfashion" is how this girl captioned her hair look.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>But who says girls are the only ones entitled to the fun?
