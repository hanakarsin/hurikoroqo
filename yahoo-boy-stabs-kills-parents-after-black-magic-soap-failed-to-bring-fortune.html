I am angry with my parents, particularly my mother, for giving me a fake name instead of her real name.</p><p>“There is a particular black magic soap that I have been using lately. The soap was given to me by the priest of a white garment church named Mathew.</p><p>“I was the one who bought a generator for Pastor Mathew’s church around Ona Grammar School in Ogbomosho.</p><p>“The soap was meant to bring me good fortune, but there was the need for me to call my mother’s name into it before it could work.</p><p>“My mother told me that her name is Titilayo. But when I called the name into the soap, it did not work. Hence, I got angry and decided to stab her.”</p><p>However, Daniel’s mother, Titilayo said she did not collect any money from him.</p><p>She said, “I was called on the phone to come pick up my son from school at LAUTECH when he started exhibiting mental illness.</p><p>“When we got home, his father brought a native medicine home and gave him to use. He slept off after taking the medicine.</p><p>“However, when he woke up, he demanded the whereabouts of his phone and I told him I did not take his phone. He landed several blows on me.</p><p>“He is a liar; I did not collect any money from him.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5FwZrKZmKS8bq7OsmSsrJGXwG63yKWjrGWglr%2BmutOsZJqepJq%2Fbq7LmpqkZZ2WtKqvjKymmqhdm66quMSdZK2nXZe%2FqrrGZp2oqqSqu6Z7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
