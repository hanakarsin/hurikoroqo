Each of the remaining contestants has created a solid connection with the Bachelorettes, but only time will tell what chaos will ensue ahead of the <a href=#>Season 19 finale.</a></p><p>Though we have some predictions and potential spoilers, the only real way to know who <a href=#>Gabby Windey</a> and <a href=#>Rachel Recchia</a> pick in the end is to tune in each week.

Pay attention, because things are getting a shakeup for the remainder of Season 19 schedule of The Bachelorette!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here’s the 2022 episode schedule for Season 19 of ‘The Bachelorette.’</h2><p>This season of The Bachelorette is unlike any other. Two leading ladies mean twice the eliminations and double the drama. It also makes sense that the schedule will be switched up a bit.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span><p>Rachel Recchia and Tino Franco</p></figure><p>In the Monday, Aug. 22 episode of The Bachelorette, Gabby and Rachel conducted their fateful hometown visits.

Previously eliminated contestants had the opportunity to get everything off their chests and many of the viewers’ questions were addressed.</p><p>Now here's where things get a bit confusing. Next up were the <a href=#>Fantasy Suites</a>, which aired over the course of two back-to-back episodes on Monday, Sept. 5 and Tuesday, Sept. 6.</p><p>Then, due to the return of Monday Night Football, <a href=#>The Bachelorette delayed the following episode until Tuesday, Sept. 13</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span><p>Erich, Gabby Windey</p></figure><p>In the same vein, the Season 19 finale airs on Tuesday, Sept. 20. Although these remaining episodes will run on a different day of the week than usual, as always, The Bachelorette will still air at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.</p><p>Now that we’re clear on the season finale, viewers are dying to know when the After the Final Rose special premieres. Here’s what we know!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">When is the ‘After the Final Rose’ special? The identity of the next Bachelor will be revealed!</h2><p>Much like previous seasons, Gabby and Rachel’s After the Final Rose episode will air immediately after the Season 19 finale.</p><p>At the live special, Jesse Palmer is expected to announce which Season 19 contestant will take up the mantle of The Bachelor in Season 27. Though no details have been revealed as of this writing, viewers have cast their predictions.</p><p>In addition, Reality Steve has shared some pretty juicy <a href=#>spoilers</a>.</p><p>To find out what happens on Season 19 of The Bachelorette, tune in on Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC. <a href=#>Hulu subscribers</a> can access new episodes the next day!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl66ktMSlpqudpKmybn6Pa2lmnaCewLCwxGaqnKCVmcKtsQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
