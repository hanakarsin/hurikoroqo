As far as I am concerned, I will continue to be the Chairman until the time elapses.</p><p>“Secondly, we inaugurated the members that are not statutory members. These members include one BoT member from each state of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory, FCT.</p><p>“Another category is five members of the PDP from the six geo-political zones.</p><p>“In the zones, there may be three men elected and two women selected while the states produce one each.</p><p>“So, we have 37 members of BoT from the states and 61 members from the zones. These are the people who came today to be inaugurated and they have only three years to serve as BoT members after which their tenure elapses.</p><p>“We have inaugurated them and they came from all the states and zones in Nigeria. So, today, we have the full members of BoT.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe49xZmtoYmh6u7vNoqWgZaCZvW6uzqyqZqKZl7%2BquoyrnK%2BdkaHAbrvUrZqopZVivKd5wairZqWVmsGqusZo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
