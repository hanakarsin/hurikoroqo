Both hosts also repeatedly make fun of Asian accents and make disparaging remarks about Chinese food.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>this, again, is from September 2018 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/inYFT22zjl</a></p>— Seth Simons (@sasimons) <a href=#>September 12, 2019</a></figure><p>"An Asian trying to learn English bothers me more than someone listening to, like Lil Uzi Vert while I'm trying to eat f--kin' dinner,” Shane says later in the episode.</p><p>He has also made homophobic jokes in the past and called Judd Apatow and Chris Gethard "white f----t comics" in another episode. (Not that it makes the comment more or less offensive, but both Apatow and Gethard are straight.)</p><p>Gillis took to Twitter to address the backlash with a screenshot of a statement written on his phone. "I'm a comedian who pushes boundaries. I sometimes miss," he says. "I'm happy to apologize to anyone who's actually offended by anything I've said," he continues. "My intention is never to hurt anyone but I'm trying to be the best comedian I can be and sometimes that requires risks."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=und dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/fw7QJHLFdi</a></p>— Shane Gillis (@Shanemgillis) <a href=#>September 13, 2019</a></figure><p>But the "apology" wasn't warmly received by critics online. Writer Roxane Gay replied, "It's not risky to be racist. It's boring. The material wasn't even funny. Apologize for that."</p><p>The so-called jokes made by Shane —&nbsp;less than a year ago, by the way, not in the early '90s or earlier when humor like that might have been seen as "edgy" — will likely make things super awkward between him and new castmate Bowen, who so far has been silent on the matter.</p><p>However, it's possibly telling that Bowen shouted out fellow newbie Chloe in his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram story</a> and not Shane, which some might read as shade.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>But so far, it seems like SNL is standing by their casting decision.&nbsp;</p><p>The new season of Saturday Night Live premieres on Sept. 28.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLWiusRmnqKknJ7Abr7AnKCsrA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
