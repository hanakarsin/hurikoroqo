Many people try to be optimistic and keep an open mind, as this isn't the case with every male shopper — but it's an accurate description for this guy we'll tell you about right now.</p><p>On Oct. 2, 2023, <a href=#>TikTok</a> creator Adrielle Sigler (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@veganrizz</a>) shared that her male Instacart shopper claimed numerous items were "unavailable" — but when she went to the store, she found all the groceries herself.</p><p>Read on for the full story.

As a result, the TikToker decided to prove the lazy shopper wrong by taking Thanos's advice: "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fine, I'll do it myself</a>."</p><p>Adrielle set out with her shopping cart and instantly found the "unavailable" items on her grocery list. She grabbed the blackberries, which were fully stocked in different size containers. The Cheez-Its she wanted were out of stock, but the TikTok creator said there were two acceptable alternatives her shopper could've picked up.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@veganrizz href=#>@veganrizz</a><p>Replying to @Adrielle Sigler <a title=greenscreen href=#>#greenscreen</a> <a title=adriellecsigler href=#>#adriellecsigler</a> <a title=adriellevegan href=#>#adriellevegan</a> <a title=adriellecherrie href=#>#adriellecherrie</a> <a title=adriellecherriesigler href=#>#adriellecherriesigler</a> <a title=adrielle href=#>#adrielle</a> <a title=adrielleisvegan href=#>#adrielleisvegan</a> <a title=adriellesiglervegan href=#>#adriellesiglervegan</a> <a title=adrielliverse href=#>#adrielliverse</a> <a title=adriellesigler href=#>#adriellesigler</a> <a title=veganrizz href=#>#veganrizz</a> <a title=adriellesigler href=#>#adriellesigler</a> <a title=adriellevlog href=#>#adriellevlog</a> <a title=adriellethoughts href=#>#adriellethoughts</a> <a title=adriellecreator href=#>#adriellecreator</a> <a title=adriellesiglercreator href=#>#adriellesiglercreator</a> <a title=adriellesiglervlog href=#>#adriellesiglervlog</a> <a title=stressed href=#>#stressed</a> <a title=angrycustomer href=#>#angrycustomer</a> <a title=instacartfail href=#>#instacartfail</a> <a title=instacart href=#>#instacart</a> <a title=ripoff href=#>#ripoff</a></p><a title="♬ Quirky Suspenseful Indie-Comedy(1115050) - Kenji Ueda" href=#>♬ Quirky Suspenseful Indie-Comedy(1115050) - Kenji Ueda</a></figure><p>She easily found the almond milk, protein bars, strawberry lemonade, plant-based chicken wings, and other groceries the shopper claimed were "unavailable." To prove her point even further, Adrielle walked to the other side of the store and found the bottle of sweet chili sauce she requested in her order.</p><p>"I don't think I've been this triggered in a long time," the TikToker explained. "Unless it's an absolute emergency, and I am debilitated, and I need Tylenol and tampons or something, I am never using an app like Instacart, DoorDash, Uber Eats, or GrubHub again in my life."</p><p>She noted, "It's really frustrating when you pay a service fee, you tip, and pay for groceries with the priority pay option, you fall for all of that, to [then have to] drive to the grocery store after a funeral and find all of the 'unavailable' items the shopper couldn't shop for."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Adrielle's video about her Instacart shopper has divided TikTok.</h2><p>At the time of writing, the now-viral video has garnered over 864,000 views and received over 1,600 comments. Many fellow TikTokers weren't on Adrielle's side in this situation, telling her to shop for the groceries herself.</p><p>One TikTok user wrote, "If you have the time to go to the store and can find the items this easily, why don't you just cut Instacart out of the equation, lol."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok / @lostretainers</span></figure><p>"Moral of the story: Do your own shopping," a second person said, while another user pointed out, "That doesn't mean the store didn't stock in between the shopper being there and you getting there."</p><p>A fellow shopper commented, "Sometimes they're genuinely out when you're shopping and then restock before your next batch. I double take every time like, 'Bruh that was NOT there 30 mins ago.'"</p><p>Someone else replied, "Be kind to Instacart shoppers!
