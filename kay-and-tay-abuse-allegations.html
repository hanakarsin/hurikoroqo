Taylor and Kay Dudley have gained popularity with their videos showcasing their pregnancy journey, funny relationship antics, and more — but things may not be as wholesome as they seem.</p><p>Indeed, users on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kay and Tay "snark" Reddit community</a> have surfaced an alleged arrest record from 2019 belonging to Taylor, which shows that he was arrested for domestic violence against Kay. Here's what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: instagram/@kayandtayofficial</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Taylor of Kay and Tay faces domestic abuse allegations.</h2><p>Though Kay and Tay try to promote happy and healthy relationship dynamics, the latest allegations against Taylor are anything but. According to an arrest record posted to Reddit, he was arrested in 2019 in Alabama — where the couple lived at the time — for domestic abuse against Kay.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A TikTok by user Te-Erika</a>, which delves into the specifics of the arrest, claims that "he threw her down on the bed and then to the floor ... then put her on the bed and pinned her down while she feared for her safety." A few years later, the couple left Alabama and moved to Dallas, Texas where they began their content creation journey.</p><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a screenshot</a> of a now-deleted TikTok exposing the situation, posted to the "Kay and Tay Snark" Reddit page, Kay took to the comments to defend her partner: "Tay took the fall for something he didn't do. ... He was not charged with abuse. He was charged with harassment, which was completely dismissed and dropped the next day because he was innocent."</p><p>However, viewers generally don't believe her explanation.</p><p>"You should never take the fall for anyone. Ever. I don't care who you are. This is nothing but a gaslit excuse," one user on Reddit wrote.</p><p>Another said, "Took the fall for someone else, for harassment? They're gonna have to cook up a better story than that."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kay and Tay Dudley (@kayandtayofficial)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Kay and Tay have also been accused of faking their videos.</h2><p>Aside from the serious allegations against Taylor, this isn't the first time that the TikTok couple has received some negative attention. Many users on the app — and beyond — feel that Kay and Tay's videos are largely staged and "cringey."</p><p>On the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"MomTok Gossip" Reddit</a> community, one user posted, "The first time or so I saw them, it was kind of cute, but now everything seems so planned and staged and fake. The way they act… there is just no way that’s how they behave/talk/interact off camera. It’s very cringey. I understand we are all different, but it’s too much."</p><p>Another wrote, "The more I pay attention to it, Tay seems very controlling ... Kay’s a perfectionist who acts infantile. But EVERYONE eats them up! It’s so wild to me that no one sees through them."</p><p><strong>If you or someone you know is experiencing domestic violence, call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoK66ecCnm2aska56oq7UrJxmmZyhsqit06Kmp6s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
