While some of <a href=#>these styles are wilder</a>, and therefore a bit more complicated than others, each of these <a href=#>9 Halloween nail ideas</a> will be sure to wow your friends all month long.</p><h2>Get creative this year with these spooky Halloween nail ideas:</h2><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">1. Witchy Nails</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>These nails are beautiful because they're not too overstated and you have to look close to realize they're even Halloween-themed. Otherwise, they're just a lovely chrome purple with a matte finish. Add the witchy stamps in white varnish and they're perfect for a spooky costume, then recycle the style without them for the rest of the year.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2. Spider Web Nails</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Now this is a web we wouldn't mind being tangled in! This gorgeous set boasts web painted accent nails, gems, and an elevated French design that bridges the gap between an elegant and sassy look.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3. A Witch on a Starry Night</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>There is so much beauty going on in this nail style, which makes sense since the artist says they "mixed two challenges in one mani." Those challenges were "wicked witches" on the one hand, and "stars" on the other, and boy do they come together to make the perfect fall night manicure.</p><p>The detail here is absolutely gorgeous; look at those trees!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">4. Orange Glitter with a Twist</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Step into the world of Halloween glam courtesy of this orange extra-long square set. This number switches things up with gold glitter nails and a solid color accent nail with a glitzy spider. It's chic and right on trend.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">5. What are YOU looking at?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Eyeballs make the perfect Halloween nails, but this person went the extra mile by incorporating what looks like an actual three-dimensional ball into the manicure. Extra points for the simple bloody touches on the otherwise natural nails around it.</p><p>This manicure is guaranteed to turn some heads!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">6. Pumpkin 'n' Things</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Not quite sure where to turn for your Halloween manicure look? Luckily, this pumpkin-inspired mani is a great way to get into the spirit while taking a simple-meets-trendy touch. With a mix of jack-o'-lanterns, ghosts, and themed leaves, this manicure will knock your look out of the park.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">7. These nails are 'IT'!</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>When the time of the year comes around to decide what to dress up as, we tend to think first of the best scary movies we've seen. With the popularity of the recent IT films, this manicure is all the more amazing. It's got it all from the scary clown, to glittery blood, and even an uncanny reproduction of the logo. We also love the black matte nails that give the designed nails more room to shine.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">8. Alien Nails</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Any talk of aliens is a surefire way to either creep or pique someone's interest. And when it comes to a manicure set, it's likely to meet the latter. This design adds a gloomy yet beautiful touch to the world's most mysterious creature, which is right on trend for the spooky season.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">9. Candy Corn Nails</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Candy corns aren't that yummy when it comes to candy, but when it comes to nails, we're obsessed with the look. We're loving the camouflage vibe here of the nails digging through candy corn, which we recommend re-creating if you go for this manicure. More than that, without the context of Halloween, these colors would look cute together at even a springier time of the year.</p><p>Happy Halloween! We hope these Halloween nail ideas inspire you to go for a creative, spooky, or even cute manicure this season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfna6tuM6wnJ6mXaOuqriMopuemaM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
