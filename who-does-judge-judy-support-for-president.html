And she has been since her self-titled small-claims courtroom show made its debut in 1996. The wildly popular show will come to an end in 2021 after an impressive 25 seasons.</p><p>As for Judge Judy herself? She’s the highest-paid television host in the country. She is now worth a whopping $440 million and counting, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Forbes</u><u> reports</u></a>, which lands her on the list of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>America’s Richest Self-Made Women</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>And we’ll see more of her as the 77-year-old’s new show, <a href=#><u>Judy Justice</u></a><u>,</u> is already in the works. OK, now that we’re caught up with her uber-successful career, what about her political affiliations?

Things were run effectively and efficiently during his 12 years as mayor. He’s a brilliant, self-made guy who runs and manages thousands of people, and has for 30 years.”</p><p>Judge Judy has not publicly endorsed any other candidate since.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is Judge Judy a Republican?</h2><p>No, Judge Judy is not a Republican — she’s a registered Independent.</p><p>And for being so outspoken, she’s known for being hush-hush about her political opinions in general, leaving people surprised when she stepped out in support of Michael Bloomberg. He ran for mayor as a Republican and an independent before returning to the Democratic Party.</p><p>At one point, there were rumors swirling that Judge Judy could possibly be Donald Trump’s 2020 running mate.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>She quickly put those rumors to bed on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</u></a>.</p><p>And on the contrary, she has publicly called the president’s actions “a plague of disrespectful political discourse,” as the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Chicago Tribune</u><u> reports</u></a>, wanting to do her part to help the nation heal by backing an able candidate.</p><p>Judge Judy has spoken, and many are waiting to see if she’ll speak out again.
