Director Ti West, along with starring actor <a href=#>Mia Goth</a>, created and shot both films at the same time, transforming 1970s Texas into a World War I fever dream.</p><p>After's Pearl's credits, viewers were treated to a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">teaser for the third movie</a> in the franchise — MaXXXine. So, given that the first two movies released in such quick succession, when can we expect to see the highly anticipated sequel to X hit theaters? Was it filmed at the same time as its predecessors? Here's what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: A24</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">When is 'MaXXXine's' release date? It could be sooner than we think.</h2><p>With X hitting theaters in March 2022 and Pearl following not long after in September 2022, viewers were hoping that the trilogy's finale, MaXXXine, would be released in early 2023 — but to the dismay of Maxine Minx fans everywhere, that wasn't the case.</p><p>However, recent reports have stated that the film has undergone limited test screenings in California, meaning that we could finally see it hit theaters soon.</p><p>According to a report from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">World of Reel</a>, the film was shown to audiences in Burbank, Calif. on Dec. 8, 2023, with general reviews seeming positive. While the film team may still need a few months to incorporate any feedback they receive from the test screening or make final changes, this news means that MaXXXine will definitely be gracing our screens this year, and hopefully by summer.</p><p>It is worth noting that no official release date has been announced by A24, so any information is speculation at this point.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Maxxxine will be set in Los Angeles????

So, was MaXXXine filmed in the same location?</p><p>Taking place a few years after the events of X, MaXXXine is set in Hollywood, Calif., as Maxine Minx tries to find fame as a film star. According to reports by World of Reel, filming took place in Los Angeles, meaning that the movie's sets will likely be very true to the subject matter. As for specific filming locations, we will learn more as additional trailers are released.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>(l-r) Mia Goth, Lily Collins, Halsey</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The official 'MaXXXine' cast list has been announced.</h2><p>To much excitement, A24 dropped <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">another MaXXXine promo video</a> on April 5, 2023 — and this time, it included the movie's cast list.
