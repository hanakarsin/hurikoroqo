To most others, they look like horse hooves. But no one would ever say that aloud. That's practically hate speech.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>wdym my uggs wonâ€™t keep my entire body warm when wearing a mini skirt and bare legs during winter</p>â€” karo ï½¡Ëšâœ§ (@elfbunnyz) <a href=#>October 16, 2022</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Uggs are like an umbrella during a storm.

It usually starts during late fall or early winter. But for some peeps, it can start as early as September. It's different for every Ugg owner. For many women, Ugg season begins on the first morning they wake up after summer has ended and think "wow, I'm freezing." Some owners may hold out a bit.</p><p>Also, it's a tradition for Ugg owners to take a photo of their Uggs and/or their OOTD to mark their first day of Ugg season. Basically, if you don't tell or show everyone on social media that you've busted out the Uggs already, did it even happen? (The answer is no!).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqrSoedKemKynnmK6prnErA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
