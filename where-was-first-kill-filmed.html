It's a subgenre that is truly for the people. And by "the people," we mean sapphics with taste. <a href=#>Netflix</a>'s new teen lesbian vampire saga <a href=#>First Kill</a> has undertones of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and nods to the iconic late-'90s drama Buffy the Vampire Slayer.</p><p>Based on the short story by New York Times best-selling author Victoria "V.E." Schwab — who also created the <a href=#>wonderfully queer series</a> — First Kill follows two high school-aged girls who both have a dark secret. The series takes place in modern times, so don't expect a late-1800s Bram Stoker's Dracula-type storyline. Considering Transylvania is certainly not the setting for this supernatural teen melodrama, where is it set? Let's discuss First Kill's setting and filming locations.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Where was 'First Kill' filmed?</h2><p>First Kill is set in modern-day Savannah, Ga. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cinemaholic</a>, it was also filmed there. Specifically, some scenes were shot at Savannah's Colonial Park Cemetery. According to the official <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Savannah, Ga., website</a>, the six-acre cemetery was established in 1750, is over 100 years old, and boasts more than 9,000 graves.</p><p>Other scenes were shot in Georgia's capital city, Atlanta — which is known to have several production companies and facilities.</p><p>Georgia's affluent suburb East Cobb — which is north of Atlanta — was also reportedly utilized for filming. Known for its trails and closeness to the Chattahoochee River, East Cobb is equally earthy and ritzy.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Netflix US (@netflix)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram/@netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Stars Sarah Catherine Hook and Imani Lewis said representation occurred behind the cameras as well as in front of them.</h2><p>In the show, Juliette Fairmont (Sarah Catherine Hook) comes from a family of vampires, and Calliope Burns (Imani Lewis) is a monster hunter by blood. The two girls should be mortal enemies, but instead, their undeniable attraction leads to a passionate romance amidst a generations-long family rivalry.</p><p>It's obvious that an interracial lesbian vampire and vampire slayer relationship is progressive in more ways than one, and we love to see it. But First Kill's alluring leads relayed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS News</a> that diverse representation was also present behind the scenes.</p><p>"We had the best crew. I just loved everyone and I'm still friends with pretty much all of them because we all got very close very quickly. And I really appreciated that the representation wasn't just on the show but also behind the scenes. We had crew members of color and queer crew members and I just loved every minute," Sarah explained.</p><p>Imani chimed in, gushing over how wonderful the crew members were: "These producers, these directors, all phenomenal. Even the behind-the-scenes part that no one really gets to see — hair, makeup wardrobe. I felt like I was able to better channel and better understand the communities that I was representing because I was surrounded by them."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>first kill <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/nYxR4mjqBZ</a></p>— ⋆ (@loversquarrelI) <a href=#>June 11, 2022</a></figure><p>"For audiences, I want people to feel seen and heard and respected and represented when they see this show and see these characters, and I want them to feel like it was done with care," Imani continued.</p><p>No matter what you think of First Kill as a work of art, it's a beacon of hope for diversity in the fantasy genre, as well as mainstream entertainment as a whole.</p><p>Season 1 of First Kill is currently streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmrpqrXZu2s7%2FTZqKipJxis6q4zJ6b</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
