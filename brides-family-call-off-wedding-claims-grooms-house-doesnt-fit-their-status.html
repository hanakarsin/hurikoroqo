This was a decent new terrace house? They said they wouldn’t want their daughter to go suffer as she grew up in wealth!!!</p><p>“The said husband to be is a decent, well educated person with a good job and also from an upper class family too; his parents said that’s all they could afford to house her as the house was gifted to him by his father.</p><p>“The bride’s parents even offered to get a better house that suits her status. However, the husband and his parents stood firm.</p><p>“Consequently, wedding was called off. She went ahead to marry some socialite who practically does nothing. She basically missed out on a great person.</p><p>“Sadly, there are too many of such stories. Weddings are cancelled due to some trivialities and misplaced priorities.</p><p>“Ironically, most of these parents had humble beginnings devoid of the luxuries they place so much importance on. They never allow their kids to navigate life on their own.</p><p>“Weddings and marriages have become like some competition. It’s mostly a lavish display of wealth, power, materialism, outshining of others etc; it’s truly no wonder marriages last a second.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ze5FwZpuqmZmytHnFmqSipKlisKK4y2amn55drLKlsMinnmabnJa2rr%2BMoKmop52oeqm71KycZpyfmsCvwIyfoK1lpJ2yqr6MrKuarKWofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
