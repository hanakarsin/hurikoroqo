Her recent streak on Jeopardy! has catapulted her into the limelight, not merely as a quiz show contestant but as a phenomenon that has the Jeopardy! community and beyond buzzing with excitement.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: ABC</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What is Victoria Groce's job?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Verywell Fit</a>, Victoria works as a freelance writer. Her work has spanned various niches, including writing about restricted diets and science for Gluten Free and More (which was previously known as Living Without Magazine) and Mental Floss. Additionally, she has lent her skills as a freelance editor to academic dissertations and publications for university presses.</p><p>Victoria pursued her undergraduate studies in comparative literature at the University of Georgia, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts in the same field. Even more impressively, she completed post-baccalaureate courses in genetics, biochemistry, and physiology at the University of Pittsburgh.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@gracewithano</a></figure><p>Victoria, who won the first-ever Invitational Tournament, is currently competing against five other contestants for $500,00 on <a href=#>Jeopardy! Masters</a>. During the premiere of Jeopardy! Masters, host <a href=#>Ken Jennings</a> talked to each of the contestants. Ken spoke to Victoria and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>, "And our viewers probably remember you from <a href=#>The Chase</a>, where you were known as The Queen." Victoria responded and said, "Are." Ken replied, "Are, sorry."</p><p>However, Victoria's correction of her title from The Chase left fans wondering if The Chase is getting canceled.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Is 'The Chase' canceled?</h2><p>The last episode of the TV show aired in July 2023. ABC hasn't shared any update on whether or not the game shot will return. According to TV Series Finale, it isn't known if there will be a new season of The Chase available. As of May 2024, there isn't a new season that's scheduled to air. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">On Reddit</a>, fans speculate about whether there will be more of The Chase.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@abcnetwork href=#>@abcnetwork</a><p>TONIGHT, the Jeopardy!

She’s still The Queen in the way that you’re the Queen (given your username), you don’t need a TV show to tell you you’re The Queen of trivia, nor do they have exclusive rights to call her that, and she’s absolutely right about that."</p><p>Another fan commented, "I took that interaction as her being like 'the show is over but hey I’m still the queen' like in general, as a joke. I could be wrong though. Just feel like if they were trying to advertise something they would’ve been more specific."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfq7akwM6roJpll6e8pLGMo5yoqJGnsbo%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
