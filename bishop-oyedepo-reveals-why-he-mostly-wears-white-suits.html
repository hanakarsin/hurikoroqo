It is the cheapest thing to wear. White suits are the cheapest or you don’t know, try it.</p><p>“Praise God. I used to crack joke with a friend and said, you see my dress, the whole thing; how much does it cost because I have the permanent white up and down that I wear.</p><p>“If I don’t change, you can’t know because if it fades, it fades to white. White can’t fade to black, it can only fade to white”.</p><p>Meanwhile, Nigerian Tokyo Olympics Bronze medallist, <strong>Ese Brume</strong>, has revealed <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>she plans to wear her bronze medal</a></strong> on Bishop David Oyedepo, the general overseer of Living Faith Church Worldwide.</p><p>Before leaping to her first Olympic medal with a jump of 6.97m, she could be seen saying “God of David Oyedepo, I want to do this.”</p><p>Speaking after her win, she said she was dedicating her first Olympic medal to Bishop Oyedepo, her coach, Kayode Gaya, and her family.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH15e49wZpuho528sXnOspydnaCkerOx1Z6YpatdrLW6eceeZKano6m5unnWnpirq12starAxGaqrqGkqHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
