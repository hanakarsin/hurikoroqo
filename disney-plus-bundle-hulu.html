Here‚Äôs how to get the Disney Plus Hulu bundle, plus everything we know about sharing accounts and the huge lineup.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>The <a href=#>Disney Plus </a>launch is finally here! Are you ready to rewatch all your favorite childhood classics while also enjoying a ton of new original content? Are you ready to let Mickey Mouse become the corporate overlord he was clearly always meant to be? If so, we‚Äôve got all the info you need to know about the Disney Plus launch date.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here‚Äôs how to sign up for a Disney Plus Hulu bundle:</h2><p>There are so many different streaming services these days that you may be wondering: Can I just get a big ol‚Äô bundle so I can watch all of my shows in one place? Well... no. At least, not until Disney officially owns everything. (You know it‚Äôs only a matter of time, right?)</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I‚Äôm sorry Hulu.<br>I‚Äôm sorry Netflix.<br>I‚Äôm sorry Vudu.<br>I‚Äôm sorry Youtube.</p><p>But make way for my next obsession, <a href=#>#DisneyPlus</a></p>‚Äî Ethan Karnes (@karnes_ethan) <a href=#>October 14, 2019</a></figure><p>But right now, since Disney owns mostly everything, there actually is a Disney Plus bundle that might interest you. Earlier this year, Disney CEO Bob Iger confirmed that there will be a bundle including Disney Plus, <a href=#>Hulu</a>, and ESPN Plus. The bundle will cost $12.99/month ‚Äî that‚Äôs pretty comparable to the cost of other streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does that mean you can add Disney Plus to Your Hulu account?</h2><p>Basically, yes! And you get ESPN Plus thrown into the mix, too!</p><p>But here‚Äôs the catch ‚Äî while you can <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>pre-order Disney Plus today</u></a>, the Disney Plus, Hulu, ESPN Plus bundle won‚Äôt be available until launch day.&nbsp;</p><p>So if you do want to get the bundle, you‚Äôre gonna have to wait until Nov. 12 to do so. Also important to note is that the bundle includes ad-supported Hulu, not the pricier ad-free version. The consensus seems to be that there will be a way to upgrade to ad-free Hulu, but it‚Äôll cost more money (obviously).</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>That <a href=#>#DisneyPlus</a> catalogue is making me wanna sign up today but the Hulu bundle isn't available until launch so... <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/n2wT0viZSn</a></p>‚Äî Hannah üêæ (@WynonnaDerp) <a href=#>October 14, 2019</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Will there be a Disney Plus app?</h2><p>We‚Äôve all gotten used to pulling up streaming apps on our phones and other devices‚Äî will we be able to do that with Disney Plus, too? You betcha!&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, the streaming platform will be coming to basically every device you can imagine including Roku, Apple TV, iPhone, iPad, Android phones and TVs, Google Chromecast, Xbox One, and Playstation 4 (via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>TechRant</u></a>). Rumor has it that it'll be available on the Nintendo Switch, too, but not in time for launch.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Getty Images</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What about account sharing? Can you share your Disney Plus account with others?</h2><p>As we all know, sharing your streaming passwords is technically not really allowed... but we also know that many services tend to turn a blind eye when it comes to sharing an account. It doesn‚Äôt look like Disney Plus will be quite so lenient, however.</p><p>When you go to the pre-order page, you get this fine-print message:</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Disney</span></figure><p>It says that you can stream on four devices at one time and have up to seven profiles. You might be thinking that means you can share your password with no consequences ‚Äî not so fast!</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a news release from The Walt Disney Company and Charter Communications</u></a>, Disney Plus may be cracking down on password sharing. The key part of the news release reads, ‚ÄúDisney and Charter have also agreed to work together on piracy mitigation. The two companies will work together to implement business rules and techniques to address such issues as unauthorized access and password sharing.‚Äù</p><p>Neither Disney nor Charter has revealed exactly what these ‚Äúbusiness rules and techniques‚Äù entail, but they could involve tracking IP addresses and monitoring broadband network usage. So just be careful.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I signed up for a <a href=#>@disneyplus</a> account to share with all three of my siblings ü•∞ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/lLjoImC11r</a></p>‚Äî Drinking with Skeletons üç∑ (@whiskeyxcigars) <a href=#>August 28, 2019</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The Disney Plus lineup is seriously incredible.</h2><p>As we already mentioned, Disney owns pretty much everything. Luckily for Disney Plus subscribers, that means they‚Äôll have access to... well, pretty much everything. Seriously. The <a href=#><u>Disney Plus lineup</u></a> is so gigantic, it‚Äôs kind of bonkers.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>It‚Äôs not just the <a href=#>beloved Disney films of your youth</a> (although those are obviously going to be there). The lineup also includes all things Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, ABC, FOX, ESPN, National Geographic ‚Äî it‚Äôs seriously pretty staggering. We have to assume that other streaming services like Netflix and HBO are getting a little nervous about it.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Netflix executives seeing the launch day list for <a href=#>#DisneyPlus</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/0SyEofQDqD</a></p>‚Äî Matthew Bouman (@MatthewBouman1) <a href=#>October 14, 2019</a></figure><p>If you‚Äôre looking to cut down on the number of streaming services you subscribe to, it pretty much comes down to the lineup ‚Äî and if you‚Äôre a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or Star Wars, well, the choice is pretty clear.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=und dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ZaH7i7WbNU</a></p>‚Äî Matthew Bouman (@MatthewBouman1) <a href=#>October 14, 2019</a></figure><p>Plus there‚Äôs the whole ‚ÄúDisney is going to own everything‚Äù thing. It‚Äôs probably pretty safe to put all your streaming service eggs in the Disney basket. They‚Äôre going to end up there eventually anyway.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmba0usSyZKmkpah6o8HNnaOeZZiqubY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
