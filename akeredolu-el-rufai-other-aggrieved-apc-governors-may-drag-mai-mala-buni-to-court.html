At least seven of these governors are with Buni contrary to what El-Rufai said. And in the coming days, more will fall in line following INEC’s verdict.</p><p>“However, for the stubborn ones, the court option now seems inevitable. Some of the governors are now discussing with a view to suspending Buni and ensuring that Bello takes over through the court. Once they can get a court injunction, INEC will be forced to comply. This was how Adams Oshiomhole was kicked out of office as the national chairman of our party.</p><p>“The challenge now is that everyone claims Buhari is on their side while the President is refusing to speak. Buhari can solve this crisis but has continued to watch while things fall apart.”</p><p>The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, <strong>Garba Shehu</strong>, neither responded to calls nor a text message on Friday.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports that Governors&nbsp;<strong>Rotimi Akeredolu</strong>,&nbsp; <strong>Nasir El-Rufai</strong> and <strong>Kayode Fayemi</strong> of Ondo, Kaduna and Ekiti respectively are among those opposed to Buni’s leadership.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e5BrZpqjlaeypbvLrmSepF2nwqetyGamraCVp3qis8aroJ6ulZl6orzCZp6orpWnu7C%2B0makmrFdmb%2Bis4ymmKJlnZa5onnBrqWiZaSkeqS71KuraA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
