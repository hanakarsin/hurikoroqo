We know their antics. They are only looking for another justification to launch fresh military operation in the South East and South-South to kill more innocent and unarmed Biafrans.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the Police have confirmed the arrest of a man, Cletus Nwachukwu Egole aka Alewa understood to be a pastor with the Holy Blessed Trinity Sabbath Church, Orlu, Imo State.</p><p>He was arrested for allegedly working as <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>a spiritual cover provider for the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and Eastern Security Network (ESN)</a></strong>.</p><p>Egole’s house was used by the gang members to plan their different operations and he also provided a farmland that belongs to his late brother for the groups to use as a hideout and training camp.</p><p>The Police has blamed the two organizations for some recent attacks on security operatives and security formations across the south-east.</p><p>The Force Public Relations Officer, Frank Mba in a statement on Sunday, noted that another person arrested alongside Egole was Michael Uba, a prophet with the Association of Jewish Faith, who confessed to working with two of the masterminds of the various attacks who had previously confessed to being active members of IPOB and ESN.</p><p>He named the two other suspects as Ugochukwu Samuel a.k.a Biggy, 28-year-old and native of Arochukwu Local Government Area of Abia State, and Raphael Idang, 31, from Odukpani Local Government Area of Cross River State.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH10e5FyZp6rnmLEpnnAq5xmpp%2BpeqjBzaacp2WZpbyjedGep6Whlah6r7XGnqmimZ5iuqq4yK2Yq7Ff</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
