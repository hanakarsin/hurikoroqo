The loan deal reportedly has a buy option.</p><p>Unfortunately, things have not worked out perfectly for Jadon Sancho despite playing more regularly than his last two seasons at Old Trafford.</p><p>He has made seven Bundesliga appearances in which he has provided two assists since he returned to Germany on January 11, 2024. But that is not convincing enough for Dortmund to give him a permanent deal no thanks to his big weekly wages which is believed to be over £250,000 per week.</p><p>“In the end, it will take money, a lot of money. Definitely more than we have at the moment,” Borussia Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl told German TV channel Sport1.</p><p>“We got over 80 million euros for Jadon. Manchester United will, of course, have an interest in either taking him back in the summer or selling him again in a deal that makes sense for them. Whether that also makes sense for us will be the next topic.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH10e49tZpunoqrAtLXAZpuoqqSiwq%2BwjKaYsmWiqrmmec6uq2aolae6orrEp6tmnJWWuW6yzqtko5mUpLtuv8CnmqGnXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
