Beyond this, the Special Forces and Guards Brigade have been activated to strengthen the security cordon around the FCT. I’m sure you have seen their show of force patrol around the city and on the highways. Nothing is being spared to keep the capital city safe and secure.”</p><h2>Intensified Routine Patrol</h2><p>On the heavy deployment of security operatives,&nbsp;the spokesperson for the FCT Police Command, DSP Josephine Adeh, noted that the patrol was intensified for visibility and confidence-building and not as a panic response.</p><p>She stated, “This isn’t the first time our men are patrolling the city. We all know what informed this question. However, I would like to reiterate the standpoint of the police as pronounced by the Inspector General Usman Baba in a publication released by the Force PRO, Olumuyiwa Adejobi, that the FCT is safe.</p><p>“This is an intensified routine patrol for visibility policing and confidence building, and should not be mistaken for a panic response at all.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5FyZqyolZi2oriMn6arm5WoerS7y52gnqqjYr2wuMicnKadnmKxtL%2BMqKeeqpGptrex0maqraeionqirtSjmGaZoqeytMCMrJqoqpWoerCyjKysrKiVmMG0ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
