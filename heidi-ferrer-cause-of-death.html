Her public<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;Instagram account</a>&nbsp;was dedicated to celebrating her sobriety milestones and her son, Bexon Lightning. The goal of her account was to inspire others to continue on their sobriety journey.</p><p>On May 26, 2021, Heidi's husband Nick posted to Twitter to let fans and friends know that Heidi had passed away. She had contracted the coronavirus in April 2020, and according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>, struggled with extreme long-haul symptoms and was completely bedridden by May 2021. Those symptoms included "constant physical pain, suffering from severe neurological tremors and numerous other worsening symptoms."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>My beautiful angel, Heidi, passed over tonight after a 13 month battle with Long Haul Covid. She was an amazing mother. She fought this insidious disease with the same ferocity she lived with.

The blog, titled&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Girl to Mom</a>, later also illustrated the daily frustration and struggle she was facing during her last few months against coronavirus complications. At one point, she wrote, "In my darkest moments, I told my husband that if I didn't get better, I did not want to live like this. I wasn't suicidal, I just couldn't see any quality of life long term, and there was no end in sight."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by RecovHer (@recovher)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>For a time, Heidi seemed optimistic that her symptoms and the pain she was experiencing would eventually fade and wrote in a January 2021 post, "I'm cautiously optimistic that I'm still improving slowly but surely every month. I had over 40 scary and even crippling Long Covid symptoms in July. Now I'm down to a few frustrating ones, but sooo much better."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by RecovHer (@recovher)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Sadly, it appears that the side effects Heidi was experiencing were overwhelming and painful, and as a result, she took her own life. Her husband Nick Guthe confirmed the news to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;Deadline&nbsp;and added to&nbsp;TMZ&nbsp;that long-haul coronavirus is "a public health crisis that must be addressed quickly."</p><p>Heidi is survived by her husband, her son Bexon, her mother, Nancy Gilmore; and sisters Laura Frerer-Schmidt and Sierra Summerville.
