Now, she's back in another big one as co-host of the 2021 Golden Globes. She and Amy Poehler teamed up for the job in 2015, but with everyone watching from home this year, the duo has to go the extra mile to make sure everyone feels like a part of the experience.&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, she's said that she won't be making any political jokes at the award show â€” but that doesn't mean she hasn't been public with her own beliefs. Her religious and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">political views</a> may not be the topic of every conversation, but she's clear on some stances publicly.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What are Tina Fey's political views?</h2><p>When it comes to her political beliefs, Tina isn't using any labels. But that doesn't mean she's shying away from them. She appears to lean more to the left of the political spectrum. She's openly advocated for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">women's rights</a> and the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LGBTQ+ community</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the years, she's called out plenty of people for their more conservative views, including people who voted for former President Donald Trump.</p><p>In 2017, Tina spoke out against the "college-educated white women" who voted for him in the 2016 election.&nbsp;</p><p>"A lot of this election was turned by white, college-educated women who now would like to forget about this election and go back to watching HGTV," she said at a fundraiser event for American Civil Liberties Union, according to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chicago Tribune</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"You can't look away because it doesn't affect you this minute, but it's going to affect you eventually."</p><p>Later on, Tina spoke directly to those women hoping they would become more aware of how Trump's policies would affect them and encouraged them to see the bigger picture.&nbsp;</p><p>"I personally would like to make my own pledge to college-educated white women to not look away, not pretend that things that are happening now won't eventually affect me if we don't put a stop to it," she said.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What are Tina Fey's religious beliefs?</h2><p>Even though Tina isn't as open with her religious beliefs like she is with her political ones, many believe she's a Christian, and she reportedly grew up in a Christian household. Tina hasn't confirmed or denied her religion, but she did get married to her husband, composer, actor, and director Jeff Richmond, in a Greek Orthodox church in 2001, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elle Magazine</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">David Letterman</a>, Tina did joke that she has "good Christian values" because she was a virgin until the age of 24 and has only had sex with her husband. Although, she does blame that on not being popular growing up. She said she "couldn't give [her virginity] away" and it's just a sign that she's "homely."&nbsp;</p><p>In general, Tina seems to be a more private person. While she does talk about her husband and kids publicly, she refuses to participate in any social media. She's made a few jokes about why she won't become obsessed with likes like the rest of us. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a>, she said she won't join until she can show her nipples.</p><p>But when actor Tituss Burgess asked her why she wouldn't join Twitter, she said, "Why would I give my jokes away for free," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Time</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbavrYyfnLJloKS5qsDInJilZaaesri%2F</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
