Viewers, therefore, can't wait to find out how it all plays out.</p><p>Ahead of the March 21 episode, Ashley spoke exclusively with Distractify about the newly-formed love square, and she hinted at where things stand today.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is Ashley Marti dating Tom Pearson or Gary King after filming 'Below Deck Sailing Yacht' Season 3?</h2><p>When the sailing season started, Tom felt a romantic connection to Ashley. After Tom admittedly drank too much on the first crew night out, Ashley had "written him off," and the two later got into an argument about whether his young age meant that he was immature.</p><p>This made it all the more surprising when the two ended up kissing after the second charter — especially since Ashley had already made her feelings for Gary known.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ashley Marti (@ashley.marti97)</a></p></figure><p>During her discussion with Distractify, Ashley shared that she didn't want to "chase" Gary.</p><p>"I don't know why I was so gung ho with tunnel vision on Gary. He was definitely more of the vibe that I was going for," Ashley said. "We got to a point where I didn't want to be the one chasing anymore."</p><p>She did ultimately connect with Tom.</p><p>"From the beginning, I said that Tom was my type. I just didn't really like the age part of it. He really is a great kid, and he's hysterical. The more time that I did get to spend with him, we definitely like our relationship was good. We had that argument the first night when we were both drunk, and we got over it," she added. "Our relationship definitely progressed very well."</p><p>Though Ashley bonded with Gary and Tom during her time on the Bravo series, it does not appear as if she is dating either one of them today.</p><p>Plus, Gary and Daisy have also already confirmed that they are not an official romantic item.

After all, she said, she was rooting for them to get together during filming.</p><p>"I respect [Daisy] so much and I love her," Ashley shared. "I definitely, at some point, was egging it on for them to actually hook up. They had their drama the season before, and I just thought it would be funny if they actually hooked up."</p><p>As a result, things remained status quo on the interior team.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Daisy (@daisykelliher87)</a></p></figure><p>"It didn't impact anything obviously, because I didn't even know it happened," she continued.
