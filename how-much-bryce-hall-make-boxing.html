After the highly publicized (and successful) fight between <a href=#>Logan Paul and KSI</a>, more influencers have been looking to get into the ring to settle their differences with other creators.</p><p>While we're sure a lot of this beef is just for show, these fights have proven to be lucrative investments for all of the parties involved.</p><p>The YouTube vs. TikTok fight was headlined by <a href=#>Austin McBroom</a> of the Ace Family and <a href=#>Bryce Hall</a> (<a href=#>Addison Rae's ex-boyfriend</a>). But how much did the TikTok star make boxing?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Bryce Hall signed a $5 million contract for the YouTube vs. TikTok boxing match.</h2><p>Despite being almost knocked out by Austin in the final round of the fight, Bryce is still looking at a decently high payout from the match. According to Complex, the TikTok star signed a $5 million contract for the fight, as well as 4 percent of the revenue from the pay-per-view sales.</p><p>The price for the pay-per-view package started at $49.99 for access to the fight, with an exclusive package for $60.</p><p>At this time, the viewership numbers for the fight have yet to be released, so it's unclear how high of a payout Bryce received.</p><p>Before signing on for the fight, Austin allegedly said that he would take a lower contract price for the fight if it meant the fight would happen.</p><p>“I told the team, I said look, I’ll agree, for Bryce Hall to fight me, I’ll agree to make less money than him," he reportedly said.</p><p>Complex reported Austin also received a $5 million contract for the match.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Bryce Hall (@brycehall)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">There was an extra $1 million bet between Austin and Bryce.</h2><p>In an effort to make the fight more interesting, Bryce and Austin made a bet with each other about who would win. If one creator knocked the other out during the fight, the winning party would receive an extra $1 million from the opposers pocket.</p><p>If you haven't already seen the clips circulating online, it was pretty clear that the pair were close to a total knockout.</p><p>Austin had originally guaranteed his fans a knockout within the first two rounds, it actually wasn't until the third round that the fight was finally called with Austin as the winner.</p><p>After scoring a couple of good punches (which Bryce needed a minute to recover from), Austin landed one more before the referee intervened, calling the fight in Austin's favor. It's unclear if the $1 million payout will still happen considering the match was technically called before a knockout occurred.</p><p>Despite losing, Bryce made a post congratulating his competitor, suggesting their ongoing feud was finally put to rest.</p><p>"Great fight&nbsp;[Austin],&nbsp;you impressed many along with myself with your skill set!" he wrote. "I'm going back to my YouTube / TikTok s--t and I'm looking forward to taking a few shots with you tonight."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4ecyumqFlkqfGpLGMoZilpF2irqyxjJumsaGenA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
