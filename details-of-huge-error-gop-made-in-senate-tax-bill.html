The alternative rate is lower, at 20%, but doesn't allow companies to take out as many tax breaks as the regular rate, which was 35%. Every tax year, corporations must calculate both the AMT and regular rate and pay the higher of the two.&nbsp;</p><p>Initially, the GOP were going to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">scrap the AMT all together</a>, but decided to throw it back in at the last minute to raise additional revenue for Republicans who were afraid that the tax bill would increase the deficit.&nbsp;</p><p>But when the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GOP wrote AMT back into the bill</a>, they left it at its current rate of 20%. Which is the same as the new, lower regular rate of corporate tax. If the bill were introduced in its current form, AMT and the regular tax rate would both be 20%, but with AMT excluding many tax breaks available under the regular rate, corporations would be forced to pay the higher AMT rate. &nbsp;</p><p>How much would this mistake cost corporations? According to Justin Wolfers, a professor at The Economics Department of the University of Michigan, income from corporate taxes would rise by about $300 billion.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>It looks like the GOP senate, by writing a bill at the last moment, accidentally passed a massive (>$300b) corporate tax hike. <a href=#>https://t.co/Ylg2Oxebu8</a></p>‚Äî Justin Wolfers (@JustinWolfers) <a href=#>December 6, 2017</a></figure><p>Lily Batchelder, a professor of Law & Public Policy at the NYU School of Law, came up with a similar number.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Appears corporate AMT provision probably raises >$300B, not $40B JCT estimated under duress Fri night.
