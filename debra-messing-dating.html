We loved each other’s children and in turn developed a beautiful friendship. We came to every school musical in Princeton, every Kidz Theatre production. We went to Broadway musicals together, and she took them to Six Flags. It was special because it was entirely chosen."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Lori Davis, Will Chase's ex-wife and Debra Messing's good friend, passed away in December 2021.</h2><p>Lori's sudden death sent shockwaves through the broader community, with many taking to Instagram to immortalize her spirit.
