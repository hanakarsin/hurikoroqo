There is nothing wrong with them. To every man, all women are good, but one would be your choice. Eleka was my choice that time, Kolawole is my choice now. It is a matter of choice.</p><p>“I have spoken with Eleka, I have spoken to all of them, Eleka will always say, ‘Oga is my benefactor’. I remain his benefactor, his brother, his political leader, nothing will separate us. It could be painful sometimes when you don’t get the support of somebody like me, I agree. But sometimes, life, to me, is ‘everything works together for good.’ For me, the choice of Eleka, I had no regret at the time. They fought me when I chose Eleka. The same way, the same set of people. I am used to it.</p><p>“If you look back, those who fought me, some people fought me when I picked them too. Some people fought me when I supported Mrs Olujimi. There was a sitting senator when I supported Mrs Olujimi, Senator Ayo Arise was there when I supported Senator Duro Faseyi. Today, Arise is a political adversary, he wasn’t happy because I supported Faseyi. Faseyi too is not my friend. This is politics.</p><p>The former Governor when asked if he dumped Eleka because of his closeness with the Governor of Oyo State, Seyi Makinde said, “Why did Governor Makinde not support him if it was because of that? Governor Makinde supported me. You don’t know the meaning of a governor. A governor is an institution, dogs don’t eat dogs; we have our strategy. As a former governor and a sitting governor, we are all together.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze49vZp6jmam2bn6Pa2lmr5iueqp5w66kqZ2UYrKtscqaZJ%2BnomKvqr%2FIZqKopJGsvK2xjJ%2BYsqejmnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
