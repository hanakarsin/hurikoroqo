Furthermore, we have lacked finesse when attacking them, even though we had it quite clear.</p><p>“Later, in the second half, when any other team would have gotten nervous, we used patience, play and that is how the comeback came. And I think that because of the chances and the game, we deserved to win, even though we recognized that the first half was very bad.”</p><p>While Real Sociedad were celebrating the rare away win, Umar Sadiq was relieved that he had finally ended his goal drought in the league. The 27-year-old Nigerian striker didn’t score in 18 games before the match against Granada.</p><p>So far in the 2023-2024 season, Sadiq who spent most of the season battling different degrees of injuries has scored just three goals for his Spanish side.</p><p>While praising Real Sociedad’s goalscorers against Granada, coach Imanol said, “Today they have been calmer and that is why they have surely scored the goals. They come to them phenomenal, to feel important, because they have also served to add three points away from home.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH10e5BpZqudkaF6tLvCopydmZRiv6atwq2qZpmWqbKzedKam6KpXaq6or6MrJqoqpWZeqm10madoqqjqXqou8ClZKKmXWd9c4CO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
