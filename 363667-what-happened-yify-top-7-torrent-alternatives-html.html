Top 7 torrent alternatives</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p class=align-left><strong>You may have come across torrenting sites that promise "unlimited downloads" of your favourite movies. For what appears to be a reasonable fee, some offer a yearly or lifetime membership that allows you to get a hold of hundreds of movies, ranging from classics to recent blockbusters. YIFY was one of the best torrenting sites but it was banned some few years back. So, what happened to YIFY?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8ae38c025ee7e65b.jpg><p class=align-left>Launched in August 2011, YIFY was a peer-to-peer online release group. The site operated by distributing a great number of movies as free downloads via BitTorrent. YIFY could easily be distinguished from the other torrent alternatives as it had the best picture quality and its files were of a smaller size compared to other torrents. Heavy traffic was generated every day, and its popularity increased, leaving competitors far behind.</p><h2>What happened to YIFY?</h2><p class=align-left>YIFY was one of Hollywood's most popular torrent sites known for releasing high-quality films for several years before it met its downfall. One day, users of the site awoke to the scene where the site showed a blank page, and this was a rare sight to see. It took many users by surprise as seldom had YIFY ever gone down for more than a few hours.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b77049bcccd40ab8.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Squid Game: Top Trending Series Rejected for 10 Years before Making Netflix Splash</span></p></a><p class=align-left>So, is YIFY closed? Yes, YIFY was permanently shut down on October 30, 2015, following a lawsuit that was made against it. It is believed that the site was permanently shut down following a lawsuit coming from MPAA, which filed a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">multibillion-dollar lawsuit </a>accusing the website operator of facilitating and encouraging massive copyright infringement. The founder of YIFY then decided to shut it down and retire.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b77049bcccd40ab8.jpg><p class=align-left>Their website was rebranded yts.re, but this too was shut down. No word was said by any staff, or those connected to it, and no new YIFY releases were made. The official site was officially closed down, and those torrents operating as YIFY proxy sites are said to be impostors.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Is FMovies safe and legit to watch movies online?</p><h2>Movie torrenting sites like YIFI</h2><p class=align-left>There are movie torrenting sites such as YIFI where you can turn to if you want to stream or download movies. These torrent sites will provide you with the latest in the movie world and will keep you entertained throughout.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5147ed81492ddc1b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to watch movies in Spanish online for free: Best sites in 2021</span></p></a><h3>1. Pirate Bay</h3><p class=align-left>Pirate Bay is one of the biggest torrent sites. The site has numerous files for download, including movies, books, music, and many others. Pirate bay was named the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">galaxy's most resilient </a>BitTorrent site. One doesn't need to register on Pirate Bay to download its movies, and this means that anybody can use it.</p><p class=align-left>The sudden growth of this torrent site is attributed to two things. First, the torrent site has been able to keep operating using its original name, unlike other sites which have had to change their names without alerting their users. Secondly, there hasn't been any long periods of prolonged downtime which makes it gain trust among its users.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>10 best Fmovies se alternatives in 2020</p><h3>2. RarBG</h3><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">RarBG</a> has a simple interface and file type filter that helps you find the torrent file of choice easily. All the basic information about each movie torrent file is listed in its detailed page. The site is among the safest to use and it serves users worldwide except for countries where it has been blocked. The only annoying thing about this site is its numerous ads.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fb3e7b7cbfa85dd5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 best Couchtuner alternatives to stream movies in 2021</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This site too has not been immune to legal action which is why it has mirror sites to make sure that it is continually available to its users. If you are seeking to use this site to get your downloads, make sure that it is not down before you load it. You can do this by using the down detectors available on the internet and testing the URL you are trying to reach.</p><h3>3. YTS</h3><p class=align-left>Unlike Pirate Bay and RarBG, YTS only provides movies and has a friendly user interface. This site also offers trailers, screenshots and also recommends similar movies for you. Questions have been raised as to whether YTS is legal or not. It is considered to be an impostor to YIFY, which was locked in 2015.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7cb4b435575c84a1.jpg><p class=align-left>Even with that, the site has continued to provide its users with the latest movies in the best picture quality and in the smallest size possible. As a result, it has amassed a huge number of followers. Most of the movies published on this torrent are of HD content. One needs to bear in mind that when downloading movies in this format, more data will be collected. Users are advised to use WIFI.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fb3e7b7cbfa85dd5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The 10 best KissAsian alternatives for watching Asian movies in 2021</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Netflix Kenya: Subscription charges and packages 2020</p><h3>4. 1337x</h3><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">1337x</a> provides torrent sites and magnet links for peer to peer file sharing through the BitTorrent protocol.

Torrent Galaxy</h3><p class=align-left>It is one of the best torrent sites for movies. The movie torrents site lets you stream online at a faster speed which makes movie lovers prefer it. The only annoying thing is its numerous ads as you browse through its website. The site features an advanced IMDB torrent search and its users can download the latest music and movies by simply putting in the IMDB ID in the Torrents Galaxy search box.</p><p class=align-left>This will result in all torrents related to the IMDB item being displayed. The torrent site is safer to use by children as it allows its users to exclude pornographic items for its users. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Torrent Galaxy</a> is the only site which has torrent arcade games.</p><h3>6. LimeTorrents</h3><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">LimeTorrents</a> is one of the best and most popular torrent sites where you can comfortably download files such as movies, music, games, anime, and so much more. The site has already gained a solid reputation among torrenters. It contains more than 10 million active torrents, something that few torrent sites can boast.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d41b7a93f4e3c315.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Eric Omondi: "I had never been arrested before, hizo vitu nimeona tu kwa movie"</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This site has a user-friendly interface and boasts of a fine selection of movies. The search bar is simple and fast, making it easy to use. One of the drawbacks of the site is that it has a low seed-to-peer ratio, and this means that users experience slow speeds when downloading old torrents that are no longer in high demand.</p><h3>7. Zoogle</h3><p class=align-left>Zoogle tops the list of user-friendly torrent websites. The Torrent site provides torrent files for new movies, TV shows, PDFs, full games, anime, software, and so much more. You can get all this stuff for free. All you need is to have a bittorrent client like BitTorrent, uTorrent, etc. installed on your personal computer.
