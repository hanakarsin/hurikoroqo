[But you have to do that] and still make sense. You still have to be metaphoric, you still have to be creative with the writing,” he added.</p><p>Speaking further, the 22-year-old said music helped in healing him faster after he was involved in a fatal car accident that claimed the life of one of his friends and left him on wheelchair for about a year.</p><p>He said the positive reception his collaboration with Mayorkun, ‘Holy Father’, got while he was still in a wheelchair, motivated him to finish up his project and follow up the success.</p><p>He, however, said the guilt over not being able to remember how the accident happened still haunts him, adding that “I just feel like maybe things would have been different if I was awake.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5FpZrCgqWK2bq%2FHmqWgnZRiurp50q2wpZ1dpLNuudSsoJxllqe8rnnRmqdmrJ9irqe%2BzpucmqyjYsOqr9OopbJn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
