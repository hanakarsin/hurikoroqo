She writes that the ride ultimately did take them about an hour to get home, however, they didn't seem to mind: "We didnt even complain but it did take about an hour to get from the club."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@laylayhurd2 href=#>@laylayhurd2</a><p>We didnt even complain üò≠ but it did take about an hour to get from the club üòÇ<a title=OLAFLEX href=#>#OLAFLEX</a> <a title=DoritosDareToBeBurned href=#>#DoritosDareToBeBurned</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - laylayhurd2" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - laylayhurd2</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @laylayhurd2</span></figure><p>She joked in the comments section, "Surprised nobody asked me why am I coming from the club and I‚Äôm pregnant. Good job minding y‚Äôall business."</p><p>Some TikTokers remarked that it was "cool" of Laylay and her companion to accept the ride from the Rickshaw rider instead of actually ordering an Uber or Lyft.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @laylayhurd2</span></figure><p>It doesn't seem likely that the man was actually affiliated <a href=#>with Lyft</a>, as the rideshare application does <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">have strict guidelines</a> on the types of vehicles that individuals are able to use for passengers who book rides through the service: "All Lyft vehicles are required to have 4 doors. Vehicles are required to have a minimum of 5 seatbelts (including the driver's), with a maximum of 8 seatbelts."</p><p>The application also states on its website that: "Taxis and stretch limousines will not be approved for use on the Lyft platform," it doesn't mention anything about rickshaws, but it's hard to imagine that a vehicle with no doors or seatbelts is considered a valid vehicle for passenger transport.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @laylayhurd2</span></figure><p>As for "fudging" the system, those who drive for Lyft must also provide <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">valid vehicle documentation</a>, which includes a VIN number as well as up-to-date insurance information (if a state requires it) and any other pertinent items. While the rickshaw driver could've certainly lied about having a car and used someone else's credentials, or has a vehicle registered in his name that he didn't want to use and would rather run around with the rickshaw instead, it's difficult to imagine that this is the case or someone wouldn't have reported him doing so.</p><p>Judging from Laylay's comments it seems that her text overlay was meant in jest, and after her post went viral, it became evident there were more than a few people who were familiar with the rickshaw man. In a follow-up TikTok, @laylayhurd2 posted a screenshot of a text message from someone who wrote that they had recognized him: "Iv seen him for years walking with no shirt or shows. Same shorts ... that's so cool."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @laylayhurd2</span></figure><p>In the additional video, the TikToker states that she's setting up a GoFundMe and will go and find him to give him the money that folks donate. People seemed a bit dubious as to whether or not they should contribute to the fund, with some even telling her to go and find him first before she collects a bunch of dough on his behalf.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@laylayhurd2 href=#>@laylayhurd2</a><p>Replying to @STARSEED‚≠êÔ∏è <a title=fyp„Ç∑ href=#>#fyp„Ç∑</a> @laylayhurd2</p><a title="‚ô¨ I‚Äôll Keep You Safe - Vluestar" href=#>‚ô¨ I‚Äôll Keep You Safe - Vluestar</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @laylayhurd2</span></figure><p>"Going to find him once you reach the goal?

The state of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">California has experienced massive surges in rent</a> all across the state and is project to jump even higher in 2022 going into 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLy2vMueZKiqlJq%2FtHnLsp2tZZeawbR50aKapKuYlsQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
