The grouse of the lawmakers, according to the person that contacted me, was that Jonathan’s handling of the last week Thursday’s invasion of the National Assembly by the police was carelessly handled by the Jonathan administration. From the look of things, the proceedings will start on Tuesday because some signatures had been collected already,”</i> he said.</p><p>However, another PDP senator who did not want his name published asserted that Jonathan is not capable of supervising over a free and fair election in 2015.</p><p><i>“Our President is not in charge. We have seen that he had allowed the governors to hijack powers from him. He is just like a puppet and the earlier we act fast, the better for us,”</i> he said.</p><p>It was further gathered that APC senators have threatened to raise Thursday’s invasion of the National Assembly by security operatives at the resumed plenary today (Tuesday).</p><p>The threat was conveyed by the group’s spokesperson, Senator Babafemi Ojudu, a member representing Ekiti Central on the platform of the APC.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> <a href=#>Plot To Impeach Jonathan Deepens</a></p><p>He said his colleagues were very annoyed with the ways they were maltreated and molested by the policemen, who were deployed in the National Assembly on the orders of the Inspector – General of Police, adding that majority of his members opined that the IGP should not be allowed to enter into the chambers, but should be asked to resign for allegedly mocking federal lawmakers who had done nothing wrong other than going to carry out their lawful legislative duties.</p><p><i>“We (APC Senators) are holding a crucial meeting this (Monday) night to take a final decision on the matter because&nbsp;&nbsp; majority of us are really angry. Some are even of the opinion that we should demand the resignation or sacking of the IGP. I can assure you that the issue of the National Assembly invasion by the police would be raised when we resume sitting tomorrow (Tuesday), but we are going to take a single position on the matter at our meeting tonight,”</i> Ojudu said.</p><p>Meanwhile, Senator Eyinnaya Abaribe, Chairman, Senate Committee on Information, Media and Public Affairs had in an interview on Saturday insisted that the Senate would not be thrown into any chaotic situation over the Thursday’s invasion of the National Assembly by security operatives.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=#>Aliyu’s Take On Emergency Rule</a></p><p>Abaribe, who hinted that the IGP would appear before the Senate also, promised Nigerians that the matter would be handled with maturity.</p><p><i>“The Senate will discuss the invasion of the National Assembly by security operatives when it reconvenes on Tuesday. Already we have invited the Inspector – General of Police to find out who gave the order for the harassment of federal lawmakers last Thursday. So, I do not anticipate any form of stormy session during our sitting next Tuesday. I can assure you that the Senate is made up of gentlemen and women who are very senior citizens of the Nigerian society. Therefore, you cannot expect the Senate to act, except in a decorous manner,”</i> he said.</p><p>He also stated that the Senate would deliberate on the extension of emergency rule in the three troubled states of Yobe, Adamawa and Borno, contrary to speculations that the matter had ended since the period of emergency had passed.</p><p><i>“We had invited the service chiefs and we will find out from them, the update on the insurgency situation in the north-eastern states of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe so that we can address the issue of the state of emergency requested by President Goodluck Jonathan,”</i> Abaribe said.</p><p>It would be recalled that the House of Assembly <a href=#>was blocked by the police on Thursday, November 20,</a> prior to the scheduled plenary on extension of emergency rule in some troubled states.</p><p>However, Niger Delta former militants have issued a <a href=#>dire warning to members of the House of Representatives </a>over the alleged plot to impeach President Goodluck Jonathan.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgHR8l29nZqiUpXq0sc2aq6iqo2LAta3RrWSmp6aaerW7jKKkqZ2RmLVuts6nmK2gkaN7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
