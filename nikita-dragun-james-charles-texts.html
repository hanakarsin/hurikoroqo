"I did not think of the competition, which was a major oversight," he continued. "I've supported Tati both online and off like she has done for me and am devastated that I hurt someone that I truly love and have endless respect for."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, how is Nikita Dragun involved?&nbsp;</h2><p>Well, Nikita took to Twitter to share texts from James that prove he was offered to promote Sugarbear on his social media platform in exchange for help at the annual music festival.&nbsp;</p><p>'Heard a situation needed some clarification," Nikita tweeted along with screenshots of her conversation with James. "My friend was in an emergency and texted me in the moment... &nbsp;i connected him with sugar bear. nothing shady."</p><p>In the texts, James asked Nikita to reach out to Sugarbear for extra artist passes because he was getting "attacked in VIP."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>heard a situation needed some clarification üëÄ my friend was in an emergency and texted me in the moment... unfortunately since <a href=#>@dragunbeauty</a> used all of our marketing budget on the ùìØùì™ùì∑ùìΩùì™ùìºùîÇ, i connected him with sugar bear. nothing shady. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/fNNtMReApm</a></p>‚Äî Mama Dragun (@NikitaDragun) <a href=#>May 14, 2019</a></figure><p>She also shared a conversation with another beauty influencer, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bretman Rock</a>, who was also contacted by James for an artist pass ‚Äî and it was ultimately Bretman who connected Nikita with James.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">However, James Charles lied about the situation following Tati's video.&nbsp;</h2><p>Before Nikita shared her screenshots, James told TeaSpill (a YouTube channel) that it was actually the Sugarbear team who reached out to him ‚Äî and offered him the artist passes.&nbsp;</p><p>"So I was getting mobbed like crazy and the sugarbear team heard about it from a few influencers that were there and they texted me and were like, 'Hey James we have an extra artist pass and safari pass for you and a friend if you need to get backstage.'"&nbsp;</p><p>James also claimed Sugarbear asked him to post the story, when it is clear that he was the first to offer the free promotion on his Instagram page.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>James made it seem like he was being mobbed and sugar bear hair rushed to his rescue.
