It is unfortunate that the president can stand on a religious podium and speak such words to his people," she said.<p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: Gideon Moi urges William Ruto to hold his horses on 2022 politics, give Uhuru space to work</strong></p><p class=align-left>Uhuru had issued a stern warning to Jubilee leaders, especially those from his backyard who were defying his directive to stop early 2022 politics.</p><p class=align-left>The evidently angry president while delivering his speech at the Akorino event described the ever politicking Jubilee leaders as "thugs" and "rubbish" and cautioned them not to take his silence for weakness.</p>“When they see me remain silent, they should not think it's because I feel threatened. I will find them wherever they are...If you are making headlines, do not think it bothers me...

They didn’t look for votes on my behalf, I went looking for my votes. These rubbish should stop bothering me,” he said moments before he apologised to the Akorino faithfuls for the angry speech.<p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: Accept Uhuru has dumped you and move on - Gideon Moi’s ally tells Kalenjin Jubilee leaders</strong></p><p class=align-left>This was not the first time the head of state lashed out at leaders for endless politicking.</p><p class=align-left>He has on a number of occasions called on leaders from both sides of the political divide to give room for development and service delivery to the people.</p>"Those who have chosen to keep politicking instead of serving the people should be ready to give way.
