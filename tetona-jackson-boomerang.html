"It’s very much like that series. There’s a storyline, but you don’t have to watch every episode in order to understand, but you should," she said in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Film</a>. So, just how did Tetona break into the acting business? Well, according to the actor, she didn't follow the usual path.</p><p>While many actors will tell you that they started off their acting career as a child, or went to school to pursue film, Tetona's path was a little different. Speaking with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shadow and Act</a>, the BET star revealed that she previously pursued a career in figure skating, even touring with Disney On Ice.&nbsp;</p><p>“I loved skating, I loved touring, but after a few years, it wasn’t what I really wanted to be doing," she admitted. "I always knew that I wanted to end up as an actress, but my path to getting here was a little all over the place." She added: “Around 2012, I decided that this is what I want to do and I started to take acting classes and take it really seriously.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: BET</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tetona's father is the legendary musician Fred Jackson Jr.</h2><p>It seems like Tetona was destined to become a performer as her father is the legendary jazz musician Fred Jackson Jr. The artist has worked with icons such as Earth, Wind & Fire, The Temptations, Aretha Franklin, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>“I would go on his gigs with him when I was younger,” she told the outlet. “Being able to watch them perform, that’s how I got into all of this.”&nbsp;</p><p>Tetona also explained that being a child around such legendary musicians was not something she realized. Adding, "But now, as an adult, I appreciate it so much more and I’m so thankful that I was able to grow up in that world."</p><p>Well, we're totally jealous!</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Tetona Saba Jackson (@itstetonajackson)</a> on Apr 14, 2020 at 5:08pm PDT</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Check out Tetona Jackson on Instagram!</h2><p>"Professional coffee drinker.
