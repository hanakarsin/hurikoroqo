Whether they're decorating their <a href=#>graduation</a> caps with topical comics, dabbing upon receiving their diplomas, or becoming the subject of a sketch on <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a> where teachers surrender to the rise of things like "<a href=#>gyatt</a>," there's nothing more fun than saying goodbye to another year of learning than by signing off with a hilarious little in-joke that only your fellow students or graduates would appreciate.</p><p>In 2024, one particular meme that's been popular among high school graduates, prom attendees, and other kids bidding farewell to school is Pose 28. Students have put on fashion shows, walked for graduation, and just simply performed the pose in public while at school-sanctioned events strictly to be a part of the meme. Want to know about its origins? Well, you would know if you've been on <a href=#>Roblox</a> lately. Here's everything you should know about the origins of Pose 28.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@californialuvswah</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Pose 28 comes from 'Dress to Impress' on 'Roblox.'</h2><p>Plant your feet firmly on the ground to get set up. Push your pelvis forward as you lean back, leading with your arms as you pull them behind you. There! You're now performing Pose 28 along with several other folks on <a href=#>TikTok</a>.</p><p>Some have made it subtle while others go in for the exaggerated lean. Either way, Pose 28 has become the hot ticket meme among high schoolers as the school year comes to a close.</p><p>The pose itself comes from Dress to Impress, a game that's available on the ever-popular gaming platform we know as Roblox.</p><p>In <a href=#>Dress to Impress</a>, players can choose a model and dress them up in various glamorous outfits. Once their 'fit is looking fresh, they can then show off their style using a variety of fashion show game modes and preset poses. As you might have guessed by now, Pose 28 is one of those preset poses and it's become widely recognized among the community.</p><p>This odd and bizarre pose has become indicative of Roblox and everyone who plays it, so it's little wonder that high schoolers have taken to performing it in public during their special events. People have been seen doing it at high school graduations, where kids lean into the pose upon accepting their diplomas. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@squirrelcomplex</a> even put on a fashion show for their prom night in which many attendees showed off their prom dresses using various Dress to Impress poses, including Pose 28.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@nobody3383884 href=#>@nobody3383884</a><p>Theme:graduation<a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=graduation href=#>#graduation</a><a title=dresstoimpress href=#>#dresstoimpress</a> <a title=viral href=#>#viral</a></p><a title="♬ Vote yodelinghaley 5 stars - haley sharpe" href=#>♬ Vote yodelinghaley 5 stars - haley sharpe</a></figure><p>There's nothing quite like using meme culture in public settings for ironic bits of humor, especially when they're being used to cap off a school year. We millennials might have hit the NaeNae or sang Cee Lo Green's "F--k You" at the end of the school year. These days, it seems as if Roblox has generated plenty of ways for high schools to graduate in style.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyiqmaon6iybn6X</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
