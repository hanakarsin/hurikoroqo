All these problems, though difficult, are not unsolvable.”</p><h2>Lack Of Political Will</h2><p>Obi asserted the institutional weaknesses and lack of political will to implement good ideas are undermining the development efforts of the country, adding that with the right leadership, political will and commitment to addressing these problems, a new Nigeria is possible.</p><p>The former governor reiterated his commitment to a purposeful leadership that draws its strength from all Nigerians, particularly the youths, in policy formulation and administration.</p><p>He stressed that the overall task of his leadership in 2023 is to streamline governance and ensure that it is responsive, transformative, and effective.</p><p>Obi said: “We will demonstrate that good governance is all about providing the needed services to the people.</p><p>“If elected the next president of Nigeria, youths would be the main proponents of my main agenda to transform Nigeria from a consuming nation to a producing nation. The two main components of this agenda are human capital development and finance. Incidentally, the central goal of today’s conference is to improve the quality of human capital.</p><p>“Thus, under my leadership, the federal government will prioritise the ability of our educational system to produce the necessary skilled labour force that coincides with the 21st-century labour market demand, alongside providing entrepreneurial education at all levels.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e5FuZqmdpJq%2FbrvBomSsnZ6ZwG65xKyqmp%2BVYsGwec2inp6qmZa7bsXOrquhq12Wtaatw2amn2ViZX90ecSlnJysmaS7tHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
