Those speakers spoke about a wide variety of issues over the course of the four-day convention. There were also quite a few speakers who had some level of wealth or influence, including Donald Trump himself, who at least claims to be quite wealthy.</p><p>One other speaker at the convention was <a href=#>Kid Rock</a> (real name Robert James Ritchie), which led some to wonder what his net worth is. Here's what we know about the rapper's net worth and how he acquired it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What is Kid Rock's net worth?</h2><p>While Kid Rock likes to act like he is a regular cowboy type, his net worth somewhat cuts against this man of the people image. His current net worth is $150 million, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, and that's thanks in large part to his skill for self-promotion, which came even before he had had a single hit record.</p><p>"This kid was doing something with the internet that others weren't hip to yet.

"The mailing lists, the street teams. He had a crew of people working the computer, doing things that at the time were really foreign.

His father William owned a series of car dealerships in Michigan, and his family property as a child was large enough that it had its own orchard and a barnyard for several horses.</p><p>So, while he may have had a rural upbringing, he doesn't really come from humble beginnings. He may have had to break into music on his own, but he had a pretty solid safety net to fall back on.</p><p>Regardless of where he comes from, though, his message seems to resonate with many people in the Republican party.</p><p>"I'm not going to get it right every time, but I know my heart's right.
