The talented actress is also known for starring in the early '90s sitcom Blossom and the not-quite-as-successful sitcom Call Me Kat. By the time June 2021 rolled around, the actress was poised to serve as a guest host Jeopardy!</p><p>Naturally, plenty of folks wondered about Mayim's personal life. Does she have children? Is she currently married? Let's take a closer look.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Mayim Bialik and Michael Stone welcomed two children before their divorce.</h2><p>Mayim and Michael Stone married in August 2003.

"After much consideration and soul-searching, Michael and I have arrived at the decision to divorce due to 'Irreconcilable Differences,'" she wrote on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her parenting blog</a> at the time. “Divorce is terribly sad, painful and incomprehensible for children.

"But we still have responsibilities to each other's families and to our children as a family.

Why is your hair like [that]?’ I don’t want to deal with it.”</p><p>(Honestly, we don't blame you, Mayim.)</p><p>In case you were wondering, Call Me Kat has officially been renewed for Season 2.
