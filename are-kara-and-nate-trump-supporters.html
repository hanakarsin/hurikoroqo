Two years later, Nate and Kara decided to quit their regular jobs, get rid of their apartment, and put their items in storage to do a year of travel before really settling down.</p><p>They saved $30,000 to fund their full year of travel, and they began their journey in Japan. When they realized that they could curate their content, put it on YouTube, and make money, they expanded their travel goals.</p><p>The pair has been full-time traveling since 2016, and they have no plans to settle down again yet. In the years since they started their YouTube channel, Nate and Kara have visited a whopping 100 countries all around the world.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>WAS 2019 A DREAM?! üåé This year we achieved the goal that we‚Äôve poured our lives into the last 4 years. When we decided we wanted to travel to 100 countries, we were about 6 months into our ‚Äúone year‚Äù trip around the world. We were loving life on the road more than we could have ever imagined, so we knew we didn‚Äôt want the adventure to end anytime soon (if we could help it). July 2016, in the middle of a hike in Cape Town, we looked at each other and said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just start telling people we‚Äôre going to 100 countries.‚Äù Our thought was if we said it out loud to others, we would be more likely to at least try to make it happen. If nothing else, we figured the worst thing that could happen was we‚Äôd get to spend a little more time traveling, then head home when we ran out of money. Honestly, the goal felt more like an unreachable dream at the time, but...here we are. 100 countries later, and it still doesn‚Äôt feel real that THIS is our life! It‚Äôs hard to wrap our minds around this last year, much less the last decade, but what we do know is that we are tremendously grateful for this life we get to live. WE are not special, but the people and experiences we are surrounded with ARE. Thank you all for the support this year, we could not do it without you. Plus, we couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better ending to an already epic year! Hitting 1 million subscribers in our 100th country ü§Ø and getting to spend Christmas in Mexico with my family ‚ù§Ô∏è Is it possible for life to get better?

The couple participated in #BlackoutTuesday on June 2, which was an online movement against police brutality and racism. Many of their Instagram followers urged the pair to do more considering how many people subscribe to their content.&nbsp;</p><p>In one comment, a user pointed out that Kara and Nate had followed President Trump on Instagram until a day before they participated in #BlackoutTuesday.<br>"Kara and Nate unfollowed Donald trump LAST NIGHT, don't let this distract you from the fact that since presumably 2015 / 2016 they have supported Trump in his attacks minorities and democracy," the user wrote.</p><p>Comments like these had many of Nate and Kara's fans wondering if the two were Trump supporters.&nbsp;</p><p>It cannot be confirmed whether or not the Kara and Nate account did follow Trump on Instagram, but they no longer do.&nbsp;</p><p>On Twitter, as of presstime, the pair does follow President Trump's official Twitter account, the @POTUS (President of the United States) account, and The White House.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>It is important to note that the two have not explicitly discussed their political leanings.&nbsp;</p><p>After receiving backlash online, Kara and Nate released a statement on their Instagram stories, which they also pinned on their main page.&nbsp;</p><p>"We have been trying to figure out where we, as two PRIVILEGED white Americans, fit into everything that's happening right now. 110 percent what happened to George Floyd was wrong. That shouldn't even need to be said. We try to see the positive in every situation, but unfortunately today, we have nothing positive to say, except: To our Black brothers, sisters, and friends: We see you. We hear you. We LOVE you," they began in their statement.</p><p>"We have spent the last four years traveling around the world interacting with and getting to know people of countless skin tones, religions, and ethnicities. Embracing different cultures and people who look different than us while we are abroad is one of our greatest joys in life. Capturing these beautiful humans on our channel to share with others also brings us joy. We hope to use this platform to continue doing so," they continued.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"Our journey has proven to us a MILLION TIMES that we are all the SAME. Which makes the fact that people don't treat everyone EQUALLY just baffling and heart-shattering. We've seen discrimination, hardships, and poverty that make our stomachs turn," they wrote.</p><p>"We are sad and confused right now. We are heartbroken for George Floyd and way too many others like him. We are sad that people in our own country are hurting and mistreated. We feel like this is SO OBVIOUS that we shouldn't even have to say it. But there it is. We will never know what it's like to go through life as a Black person in America," the couple stated. "We will never know what it's like to experience racism for the color of our skin inside our home country."</p><p>"Up to this point, we've felt comfortable telling ourselves that we are not racists, so we are not contributing to the problem. But the past few days have challenged our definition of racism. We are thankful for our past experiences that have led us to be more open-minded, compassionate, and empathetic humans. And although we are better versions of ourselves today than we were when we left, we still have a long way to go."</p><p>"To grow as people, we must be willing to re-evauluate our beliefs and actions. You can't change the world without first changing yourself, so our first step is going to be educating ourselves and doing a better job of listening; because through education, we can gain understanding. And we believe understanding is the first step towards productive action," the couple concluded in their statement.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflr%2BmecqaqZplkaOxbrrArZxmrKKqurF50q6nqaeiqbKzvw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
