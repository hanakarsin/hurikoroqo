Following their promotion, they decided to go on a mass signing spree as they signed a British record 22 new players in a single summer transfer window.</p><p>The mass recruitment reportedly cost Nottingham Forest a whopping £150 million.</p><p>In January, the Premier League charged Nottingham Forest for going beyond the £61 million loss limit. Their limit reduced to £61 million from the general £105 million (for three seasons period) because the club spent two years of the assessment period in relegation.</p><p>Nottingham Forest hired leading sports lawyer Nick de Marco to defend them, but that couldn’t save them from losing four points.</p><p>They lost the four points when they were sitting at the 17th spot on the league table after 6 wins, 7 draws, and 16 defeats. After the deduction, Forest dropped to the relegation zone. They are now sitting on the 18th spot with 21 points, a point below safety.</p><p>This makes Nottingham Forest the second Premier League club to suffer a point deduction this season for financial fair play breaches following <a href=# rel=noopener>the ten points deduction Everton suffered earlier in the season.</a></p><p>But the punishment <a href=# rel=noopener>was reduced to a 6-point deduction</a> after an appeal.</p><p>Hence, Nottingham Forest are expected to also file an appeal with the hope that they will be as lucky as Everton by getting a reduced punishment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH10e5BxZqenpKm2r7PHmqRmnp%2BnsrTAjKysn56Vp3qxu8inq6xllJqxtq%2FToqanZZakv26u0Z6YnKCZo7RuvNGepKKdomK5pq3GrpxmqqWhsrR7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
