(SPOILERS)</h2><p><strong>Warning: The following section contains spoilers for </strong><strong>Your Christmas or Mine?</strong></p><p>Your Christmas or Mine? stayed accurate to the setting of the Christmas tale by filming primarily at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pinewood Studios</a>, a legendary movie production studio building based about 20 minutes from central London.</p><p>Many famous movies and television programs have been shot at Pinewood Studios. For example, <a href=#>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</a>, <a href=#>Andor</a>, the Harry Potter films, the <a href=#>Willow Disney Plus</a> series, and many more.</p><p>Not to mention Emily in Paris heartthrob <a href=#>Lucien Laviscount</a> is in Your Christmas or Mine? too. (Sadly, it isn't looking good for Alfie and Emily's Christmas plans over in that show universe.)</p><p>Also, Lucien plays Hayley's fiancé Steve.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>Spoiler alert — James (his first name is Hubert but he goes by James in the film) didn't realize that his girlfriend Hayley had a secret fiancé. However, Hayley had actually broken up with Steve, who clearly didn't get the holiday memo.</p><p>After Hayley and James spend Christmas-time with each other's families, they realize just how much they don't want to keep things a secret anymore. Naturally by the end of the film, they reunite and are happily dating with their families' knowledge.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">How to stream 'Your Christmas or Mine?' now.</h2><p>If you have a Prime Video subscription you can stream Your Christmas or Mine? now. The movie is a Prime Video original (looks like the streamer is trying to compete with <a href=#>Netflix's</a> impressive array of Christmas romantic films!)</p><p>Because it's a Prime Video original, you can't stream Your Christmas or Mine? anywhere else but Prime Video. The movie is 1 hour and 35 minutes long, making it a perfect quick Christmas flick.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>So far, what are critics saying about the movie? Well, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Decider</a> gave the film the ultimate Christmas compliment, calling Your Christmas or Mine? "A holiday rom-com that’s less annoying than others of its ilk." In other words, its a winner!</p><p>You can stream Your Christmas or Mine? now, only on Prime Video.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrry2voycn6uho6m6or%2BMqKlmpZmjsm6yyKWkoqaXYrmwr8CtoKim</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
