The feuds have not only felt tiresome, but the influence of legal ramifications has led to the focus being on legal back-and-forths rather than hashed out the old-fashioned way of flipping tables. Season 13 saw <a href=#>Luis Ruelas</a> allegedly looking into the backgrounds of his wife's fellow co-stars, and Season 14 has its own influence.</p><p>If there is someone within the RHONJ franchise who is no stranger to legal issues, it's OG <a href=#>Teresa Giudice</a>. Longtime fans of the show have seen her go through her prison time for fraud to getting divorced from <a href=#>Joe Giudice</a>. Teresa fired her former lawyer from the fraud charges due to his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">alleged negligence</a>. Her current lawyer, however, is one that she clearly trusts, as she even brought him into the fold during Season 14 in an interesting sit-down situation. Who is Teresa's lawyer, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">James Leonard</a>?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/@jleonardjresq</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who is 'RHONJ' OG Teresa Giudice's family lawyer, James Leonard?</h2><p>Teresa and Luis's family lawyer is James Leonard. He's known Teresa and her family long enough for him not to just be considered their lawyer but a close friend. In fact, Teresa decided to inadvertently or purposefully bring him into her feud with <a href=#>Margaret Josephs</a>.</p><p>She had James there so that he could explain the activities that Margaret <a href=#>had allegedly</a> been engaging in to get back at Teresa and Luis. On paper, the whole situation is fairly simple, so why did Teresa have James come to the meeting?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/@jleonardjresq</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Teresa arranged a meeting with James and the other ladies to make them understand her personal struggles.</h2><p>While the meeting itself felt redundant for most viewers, it also seemed relatively redundant for team Teresa. <a href=#>Jennifer Aydin</a>, <a href=#>Jackie Goldschneider</a>, <a href=#>Danielle Cabral</a>, and <a href=#>Dolores Catania</a> were joined by Teresa's daughter, Gia Giudice, for the meeting.</p><p>The goal was for the ladies to truly understand everything that Teresa's pain and suffering. It was more of a "Margaret is the bad guy ruining Teresa and Luis's life" meeting. It's clear James feels deeply for the struggle that Teresa thinks she's going through.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram @jleonardjresq</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">James Leonard is also the legal representation for 'Jersey Shore' star, Angelina Pivarnick.</h2><p>Teresa is not the only star on James's roster. He is also the lawyer of <a href=#>Jersey Shore</a> star <a href=#>Angelina Pivarnick</a>, who has had a few problems with the law over the past few years. One thing that is clear from James's Instagram page is just how much he cares for his clients.</p><p>He's developed close ties with Teresa and Luis, as well as Angelina. Now, one thing that viewers would certainly love to see is a crossover moment with Jersey Shore. Or, even better, a cast shakeup that brings the Shore ladies to the Bravo world.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbKzsdKaZKChpZm2pLGMpZiwsZWnequtzJ6q</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
