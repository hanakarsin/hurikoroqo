"There's a total of 18 people under our roof. This is some challenging times. I'm the only one that leaves the house."</p><p>Scenes of the Derricos social-distancing at home then switch to shots of two members of the family having fallen ill. "I have a fever, Gigi is sick," an unwell Deon says to the camera. "People have been dying from this." That's when the jaw-dropping moment comes: "Dawsyn tested positive for COVID — what the heck is that?" an emotional Karen reveals.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>#AwesomeDawsyn has Covid</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>DEON DERRICO</a> (@deonderrico) on Sep 21, 2020 at 12:11pm PDT</p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Dawsyn's heart condition put her in a high-risk category for COVID-related complications.</h2><p>Yes, this is Dawsyn they're talking about — the daughter who was <a href=#>born with a heart condition</a> that kept her in the NICU far longer than her triplet siblings, D'Aren and Dyver. And the very same Dawsyn who required not one, but <a href=#>two open-heart surgeries</a> in order to repair the hole in her heart.</p><p>The triplets were born on July 6, 2019, and although all of them needed time in the NICU, it was quickly apparent that Dawsyn required highly specialized care. "Our reality is one of our babies is not OK. Baby Dawsyn has an issue with her heart and she's going to need surgery," Deon explained on the TLC series. "This is all taking me back to the heart-wrenching pain of <a href=#>losing my son, Carter</a>."</p><p>"I'm freaked out because our baby girl, Dawsyn, has to have open heart surgery due to VSD, which is ventricular septal defect," Karen said. "It's a hole in the heart." Because of her VSD, Dawsyn required two surgeries: one to place a temporary stent and one to actually repair the defect.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>According to the (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CDC</a>), children "who have medical complexity, who have neurologic, genetic, metabolic conditions, or who have congenital heart disease might be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 compared to other children."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Did Dawsyn Derrico die?</h2><p>A rumor that Dawsyn had died seems to have originated from an "obituary" published on a website called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deaddeath.com</a>. Thankfully, though, Deon has publicly confirmed ahead of the Season 1 finale that Dawsyn is very much alive and well today.
