She is one of Trump's longest-serving aides and was the first woman to manage a winning presidential campaign.</p><p>Upon beginning her time in the White House, Kellyanne purchased a nearly $8 million 15,000 square-foot home for her family in Washington, D.C.'s luxury neighborhood, Massachusetts Avenue Heights, just a 12-minute commute from the White House.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty</span></figure><p>Via Kellyanne and George's LLC, Antoinette Associates LLC (apparently named after her grandmother), the couple purchased the mansion, which had initially reportedly been sold to an anonymous buyer. Only later was it confirmed via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Business Journal</a> that the residence was "a Conway buy."</p><p>While Kellyanne and her husband paid $7.785 million for the eight-bedroom home, they got quite a deal on the property, which was originally listed for $22 million and was previously owned by a former Pakistani acting prime minister, the late Moeen Qureshi. The house features 13 bathrooms, a library, two kitchens, three fireplaces, and an in-ground pool.</p><p>The whole family, including Claudia, her twin brother George IV, and younger siblings Charlotte and Vanessa, relocated to the nation's capital in 2016 and live there today, though it's very possible Claudia's attempt to emancipate also involves moving away from D.C.</p><p>In fact, back in 2016, Claudia, then a sixth grader, started a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Change.org</a> petition in an attempt to convince her parents not to move to Washington, D.C. for her mom's job.&nbsp;</p><p>Claudia and the rest of the Conway children were raised in the ultra-wealthy neighborhood of Alpine, N.J., where Claudia had wanted to stay. "Please sign this petition and help me persuade my family not to move," she pled. "We love our community, friends, and nearby family and I wouldn't want to lost anything."</p><p>It remains to be seen whether the family will move back to New Jersey now that Kellyanne's stint in Washington has come to an end.&nbsp;</p><p>For her part, Claudia has changed her TikTok handle from @shortfakeblonde to @datjerseygirl, so it seems her desire to return to the Garden State remains clear.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmm6ido2K4prjLspinppVisLC61pqwZqSZq7Juus6w</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
