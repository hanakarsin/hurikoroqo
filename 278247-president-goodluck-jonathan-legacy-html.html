It is pertinent I present you with these words and thoughts before it is too late, as your godfather</p><p>There is love, there is respect, there is power, and there is nothing. Which do you possess, Goodluck Jonathan? Which will be your legacy?</p><p><strong>General Muhammadu</strong><strong></strong>has love. He is not appreciated for his wealth or power today, but he is loved. His people love him. They will take a bullet for him. They know they may never again directly benefit a single thing from him, yet they love him to death. That, Sir, is love.</p><p><strong>Mujahid</strong><strong></strong>has love. People will die for him. They respect him. He speaks for some people. Though sometimes what he says seems to be irrational to some, he is recognized as the voice and hope of others. Dokubo has love. If tomorrow he has no money and no power, there will be tons of people who will take him in, vote for him, feed him, listen to him. Dokubo has love. Love is what the poor you have no influence on say about you, not what the wealthy you surround yourself with say to you.</p><p>Take a look at</p><p>Take a look at</p><p>Then we look at you,</p><p>So what do we credit you with? Are there any statements you have made in 5 years that these first 5 will be remembered by? Have you given any international speeches, written power letters, as Obasanjo did to Margaret Thatcher on Apartheid, that the world will remember your tenure for? Have you made notable remarks to Nigerians on pressing issues, apart from repeating 'transformation,' and 'I will keep Nigerian one unless you kick me out?'</p><p>Money can buy crowds, attract people and bring electoral victories, including yours in 2015, and, who knows, in 2019 if you decide to pay for the re-writing of the Constitution and contest for a fourth term. But money cannot buy love.</p><p>Dear Sir, Goodluck Jonathan, I wish you seriously think about this. You have succeeded in deeply dividing the nation along all type of lines. This you will be remembered for. You are known for your preference to appoint indicted criminals. You will be remembered long for this. You are known for your dining with and protection of terror sponsors and inability to arrest a single one. You will be remembered long for this. Victims of terror, of economical sabotage, the 100 million Nigerians who live under a dollar-a-day will never forget you. Those whose legs got blown off by Boko Haram limitless terror through your five or 9 years, those who lost their families, whose daughters were abducted and raped, they will never forget you.</p><p>But I am interested in seeing if you know of nice things you will be remembered by. And that's not by beautiful Diezani;.And not for basic facets of governance – like building roads and repairing trains, or establishing cabal -ontrolled businesses and privatizing national assets to the cabal. I mean substantial things you will be remembered for as the president of the biggest economy in Africa. Apart from the cabal, will the poor remember Goodluck Jonathan&nbsp;and write fondly about him?</p><p>In reflection of this, I will suggest strongly you take some time to reflect. You unplug yourself from intoxication of wealth, get sober and think about you. What will you like your legacy to be?</p><p>If you carefully plan your resignation now and set up a strong system of community-represented and people's committee-based democracy (which involves direct selection from all social groups to represent themselves in Abuja leadership – market women, teachers, students, activists, pastors etc), handing over to not just a single morally upright and intelligent person, but to a committee of decent Nigerians. If memebers of the said committee will not belong to&nbsp;the current political block that gets you happily confused and deluded into thinking all is well, as Diezani stays there stealing $4 million a day in kerosene subsidy from the poor, and all is well as Boko Haram keeps killing and the sponsors remain free, and all is well as the poor get poorer and you all buy more private jets. This is how&nbsp;you preserve for yourself a name, legacy and reputation that will possibly be remembered in the ranks of the Nelson Mandela's, as you were recently touted to aspire for.</p><p>As Nigerians keep getting used to the shame, suffering and dying, the window of redemption fast closes.</p><p><strong>The 2015 general elections</strong><strong>are fast approaching, with political campaigns starting soon. Who do you see as the future leader of our country Nigeria?
