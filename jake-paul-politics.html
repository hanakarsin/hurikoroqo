So much so that he bashed the New York audience for being part of a "dumba-- Democratic" city at the Aug. 18 announcement of his match to Mike Tyson. But what are Jake Paul's <a href=#>political views</a> exactly, and what has he said about politics in general?</p><p>Jake, who originally gained an audience on YouTube by posting funny viral videos with <a href=#>his brother Logan Paul</a>, is so far removed from his former content it's not clear if he even still holds the same fan base. That being said, he still has millions of social media followers, and it's no surprise that he still uses social media as a platform for his various fights and promotion for whatever beef he has at any given time with another celebrity.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@jakepaul</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What are Jake Paul's politics and political views?</h2><p>On Aug. 18, 2024, Jake appeared at a press conference in New York City to promote his Nov. 15 fight with Mike Tyson. When he was met with boos from the audience, Jake responded with quips of his own, wherein he bashed the city and spewed plenty of expletives to show what he really thought of those in the audience and beyond.</p><p>"Shut the f--k up, New York," Jake said. "Boo yourselves, New York. Hey New York, you're just like Mike Tyson ‚Äî you were good 20 years ago. F--k you, New York‚Ä¶ Duma-- Democratic city."</p><p>From that alone, his stance on the political parties is pretty clear. But he has made it even clearer in the past through interviews and comments here and there.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>BREAKING: Boxing Icon & YouTuber Jake Paul just WENT OFF on a New York City crowd and insulted them for voting Democrat</p><p>‚ÄúF*ck you New York!

In the caption, he made his support for Trump clear.</p><p>"We need Trump to knockout all his opponents on election day to save America from more unnecessary wars, the woke agenda, and preserving freedom of speech," Jake wrote. "Make sure you exercise your right to vote. @realdonaldtrump."</p><p>Before that, in June 2024, Jake appeared on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox News</a> to share why he believes former President Donald Trump is best for the United States and why he endorses him as the next president as opposed to anyone from the Democratic party. At the time, he cited troubles with the economy and paying off student loan debts and mortgages under the Biden administration as reasons to support Trump.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Logan Paul (@loganpaul)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Logan Paul featured Donald Trump on his podcast.</h2><p>Unsurprisingly, Jake's brother Logan also supports Trump. The former president appeared on Logan's podcast <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Impulsive with Logan Paul</a> on June 13, 2024. During the episode, they covered a myriad of topics, from young voters supporting Trump to whether or not Trump believes aliens exist. But the interview was another way to cement support that both Logan and Jake appear to have for the Trump administration.</p><p>The brothers both appear to endorse Trump for the 2024 election, though they have both also said that President Joe Biden was also offered an interview on the same podcast. As of right now, neither Biden nor Vice President Kamala Harris (who is now running for the Democratic party) have appeared on Logan's podcast.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn66ssYypmK6kXaW8rbXTopqs</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
