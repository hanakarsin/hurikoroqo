It is still the same Bayelsa people that will form my cabinet and we know ourselves.</p><p>“We will consult widely and take every segment of society and all the interests into consideration. The November 11 election was not only for my Peoples Democratic Party. It was also about the All Progressives Congress and even Labour Party members. So, do not be surprised when you see some names from such parties because everyone participated in the election.</p><p>“Bayelsa is a sporting state and that is why in our second tenure, we have resolved to build a new befitting stadium.
