Baba (Tinubu) will return for more surgeries shortly after. A grand welcome is being arranged at the Nigeria Police College in Ikeja, Lagos.</p><p>“That’s if everything goes as planned and his health permits him to take the gruesome trip – because the trip is also going to tell on his recuperation.”</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> recalls that during the visit of the House of Representatives northern caucus to his home in London, Tinubu revealed that while other aspects of his treatment were going fine he was finding physiotherapy quite gruesome.</p><p>He then thanked the delegation for their presence and said he was doing well because of them and God.
