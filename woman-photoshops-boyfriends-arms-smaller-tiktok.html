There's something to be said about being so comfortable with someone that you can make jokes without having to worry about offending them or if they'll take it the wrong way. Even if those jokes might touch on someone's insecurities.</p><p>And there are a number of resources that point to the fact that the majority of men aren't satisfied with the way that they look. Well, that is depending who you ask. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hill</a> wrote that "just 42 percent of men are happy with the way they look" according to a poll conducted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Superdrug</a> on dudes in the US and UK.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Men's Journal</a> wrote that 21% of heterosexual men and 29% of gay men said they were dissatisfied with their appearance. 39% of hetero guys went on to say that they were unhappy about their weight with 44% of gay fellas stating they weren't jazzed about their weight either.</p><p>This is something to keep in mind while checking out this viral TikTok posted by a user named Chloe (@chloe_sanner).</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@chloe_sanner href=#>@chloe_sanner</a><p>Bullying him is my favorite sport <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> @colebartholow</p><a title="‚ô¨ Sneaky Snitch - Kevin MacLeod" href=#>‚ô¨ Sneaky Snitch - Kevin MacLeod</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @chloe_sanner</span></figure><p>In the video, Chloe begins by showing a cute photo of her and her boyfriend, Cole Bartholow (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@colebartholow</a>). The picture shows them smiling and posing next to one another at what appears to be a food fair or outdoor event of some sorts.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @chloe_sanner</span></figure><p>Then, Chloe begins going to work in the clip: she starts photoshopping Cole's right arm to make it look smaller and she does a pretty convincing job of doing so.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @chloe_sanner</span></figure><p>Cole's profile picture on his TikTok account appears to show him flexing his arms in what looks like a gym mirror while wearing a cut-off sleeve t-shirt. So Chloe could've very well banked on the fact that she knows her boyfriend spends time working out his arms and knew he would see her handiwork.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @chloe_sanner</span></figure><p>After photoshopping the picture, she then decides to text it to Cole and get his reaction. She sends the following message: "Should I make this my new profile picture on Facebook? Your eyes look pretty in it"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @chloe_sanner</span></figure><p>Cole then responds with, "I like that picture it's cute," before adding, "Your eyes look even better!"</p><p>However, he must've scrutinized the photo more closely as he says, "Wait. Wtf did you do to my arm?"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @chloe_sanner</span></figure><p>Playing coy, Chloe responds with a single, "?"</p><p>Cole then jokingly says, "You mother f***er"</p><p>"What you mean" Chloe texts back, keeping the game going.</p><p>He then replies with the original photo of them together at the fair, standing at a table.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @chloe_sanner</span></figure><p>"D**k," he writes.</p><p>Chloe replies with a bunch of laughing emojis. "I was like there's no way," Cole goes on to tell her.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@chloe_sanner href=#>@chloe_sanner</a><p><a title=fyp„Ç∑ href=#>#fyp„Ç∑</a> <a title=DoritosTriangleTryout href=#>#DoritosTriangleTryout</a> <a title=foryou href=#>#foryou</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - smelliot‚Äôs priv üòùüòù" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - smelliot‚Äôs priv üòùüòù</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @chloe_sanner</span></figure><p>Photoshop pranks are a time-honored tradition, with some of them a bit more heart-attack inducing than others, like this one TikToker who had their boyfriend convinced they were pregnant after sending them a photoshopped picture of a pregnancy test.
