A beautiful weekend it has been.”</p><p>The former minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode also shared the moments on his social media page stating that his children are having a swell time with their mother.</p><p>He wrote: “My princes are spending the first weekend at their mother’s place! They are having a swell time and so is mama Aragorn. Thanks be to God. God bless and be with them all. @snowhiteey well don”</p><h2>Update On Reconciling With Fani-Kayode</h2><p>A few months ago, Precious in a social media post, revealed that she can now spend time with her sons after being ostracized from them for a very long time.</p><p>According to precious she and FFK were working towards shared custody.</p><p>She stated further that she can now have long talks with her former husband for as long as two hours and still settle their differences amicably.</p><p>She wrote: “Gratitude and appreciation post. To everyone who shed a tear or two, to everyone who believed in me, to everyone who couldn’t sleep thinking of me. Words fail me!!! It isn’t perfect yet but it is beautiful. I am not in custody yet but we are negotiating terms for shared custody and end of a pending cases. Hopefully soon. Beautiful to be at peace with God, myself and others. Beautiful to kiss my boys once again, look into their eyes and make them giggle in pride, have Ikenna flash his gap tooth in excitement. Jidenna trying to bully me with his size, my Tobenna kiss me like he always does with so much admiration and love making me feel like chocolates in the hands of kids, my Lotanna leading and playing fixer or conflict resolver using the wisdom of King Solomon.</p><p>Beautiful because I also got to that point where I could sit with their father for hours, speak about the past 2 years, have intense arguments and disagreements but still find closure without bitterness, resolving to forge on separately without bad blood, putting these 4 young men above all wrongs given or received and Co-parenting peacefully. I can’t thank you all enough. Mentioning names would be shooting myself on the legs but I would be reaching out individually”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e5BuZqmqlZi2sMHSZpqhoZussq%2Bw1GaZnpmdqHq4tdOhZKOnqWKutHnFmqWiZZuWxrCwxGaYpaSfrMBuwMeeoKtlm56xtHnTqGSvoaOewW60xKtkoaedmnqnu9Fmq6GdXZu2s7%2FTZquipZVk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
